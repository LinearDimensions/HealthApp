failure Assessment of obesity Autonomic sympathetic nervous system ABSTRACT Background: An “obesity paradox ” has been reported in patients with hypertension and heart failure, in which obese patients fare better than patients with normal-weight.The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an “obesity paradox ” in patients with takotsubo syndrome (TTS).Finally, the literature on the “obesity paradox ” was explored to understand how it could be applied to TTS.Results: A prevalence of obesity of ~10 –11% has been reported in large cohorts of patients with TTS, which represents 1/3 to ¼ of the prevalence reported in worldwide general populations, suggesting that, normal-weight than obese individuals, are more predisposed to develop TTS, with the latter nevertheless also suffering TTS, when triggered by enormous physical stresses.Conclusions: An “obesity paradox ” has been identified in patients with TTS.Information about HTN and DM was also sought and recorded, since HTN is thought of being prevalent in TTS [37], at rates similar to the one encountered in patients admitted to hospitals or in the general population, and DM is thought of having a low prevalence in patients with TTS [38–41], and thus the possibly detected lower prevalence of obesity in patients with TTS, in comparison with rates found in the general population or patients admitted to hospitals with various other pathologies (as per this study ’s hypothesis), might imply that in a representative reported TTS population, obesity exerts a pro- tective effect for the emergence of TTS, as has been previously suggested for DM.Some of the data- bases/registries analyzed in Table 2, in which information on obesity prevalence in patients with TTS comprise of patients mainly from the USA or Europe, and comparisons of a prevalence of a risk factor in such cases could be either with corresponding general populations, or pa- tients admitted to the hospital with other than TTS clinical pathologies.[17] A review on women ’s CVD; obesity is mentioned as a risk factor for CVD and the importance of the obesity ’s management in the prevention and therapy is discussed; no refence is made on the association of obesity and TTS.[20] A report of a 72-year old woman with HTN, type 2 DM who suffered TTS in the setting of a strangulated internal hernia through pars flaccida defect, following laparoscopic fundoplication and right hemicolectomy for stage II cecal cancer 6 years previously; however, no mention of obesity is made.[23] A letter to the Editor regarding the interaction of obesity and DM in patients with TTS, referring to the article of reference #22 (vide supra), and pointing out that the rates of DM appeared to be lower than expected in both obese and nonobese patients with TTS.Finally, there were a few papers tangentially related to obesity and TTS (refer - ring to obesity as a risk factor, one (item #19) reporting on a patient with a low BMI, or including nonobese patients, or even patients who had not suffered TTS.Of interest is that 6 more of the most frequently quoted databases from national and multinational database/registries [37,40,42,43,45,46 ] did not provide data on obesity, while they pro- vided information on the prevalence of HTN and DM.The prevalence of obesity appears to be between 10% and 11%, if one considers the prevalence of 5.0% in the largest database of 568,239 patients with TTS [34].Epidemiology of obesity in TTS The prevalence of obesity in patients admitted with TTS is D1/3 to ¼ of the one in the general population Table 2 [1,48–52], and this is further supported by considering that the prevalence of obesity in elderly women is even greater than in men [2 [, which is of importance, since ~90% of patients with TTS are women.The databases included in Table 2 are representative of the patients who have suffered TTS, and thus the detected low prevalence of obesity should be considered cred- ible, when contrasted with the prevalence of HTN [21,22,33,34], and DM [38–41], which appear to be what has been previously reported in patients with TTS in the world literature.The above should be seen in the context of defining obesity only by the BMI, since there is debate as to whether this is sufficient (i.e., BMI may not be the best indicator of body-fat composition [53–56].The authors did not include obesity in any of their clinical clusters, but if one considers that obesity is prevalent in patients with DM [53] and is a “part and parcel ” of the MetS, who tend to have the obesity phenotype with excess body fat around the waist, obese patients probably were overrepresented in the clinical metabolic diseases cluster, the group with the best outcome, suggesting that obesity had an ameliorating effect in patients admitted with TTS.The authors of “The Observational French SyndromEs of TakoTsubo (OFSETT) study ” reported on 117 patients with a prevalence of obesity of 11.5% [16], but did not address the in-hospital outcomes of their obese versus nonobese patients with TTS.The detected low prevalence of obesity in large databases of patients with TTS (Table 2) suggests an underlying preventing effect for the TTS emergence, predisposing normal-weight individuals to TTS.It is conceivable that the “type of obesity ” is of importance, since individuals with “central obesity ” show increased SNS activity, in contrast to those with “subcutaneous form of obesity ” [55,56,59], although both such groups of individuals will be characterized as obese, based on BMI.Indeed, such phenotypes may have a different SNS response to various physical and emotional triggers, and thus may have a different degree of predilection to HTN, HF, and TTS.Thus, an expression of this great heterogenicity of obesity, emphasizing other obesity metrics than the BMI calculation, is the presence/absence of a predisposition to TTS, and different clinical outcomes in patients with DM, HTN, and HF and other pathologies [55].The issue of “obesity paradox ” in patients with HTN and other hyperadrenergic states have been systematically explored by employing in tandem assessment of the renal and cardiac SNS outflow, cardiac sympathetic nerve noradrenaline (NA) reuptake, and single fiber sym- pathetic firing discharges using invasive methodologies [3,4].Considering the noxious role of SNS enhanced activity in TTS and the modifying influence of obesity, it may be of importance, along with reporting BMI and other markers of obesity [55,56], to incorporate in the diagnostic and monitoring routine of patients with TTS noninvasive, rather than invasive [3,4] ways, of assessment of SNS activity and their impact in the blood circulation.In addition, a commercially available noninvasive technique of simultaneous recording of skin sympathetic nerve activity and the electrocardiogram (ECG) employing conventional ECG electrodes may be of true value [60,61] This well studied method has been used to es- timate the sympathetic tone, and has been evaluated in subjects with the cold water pressor test and the Valsalva maneuver, and patients with epilepsy, ventricular arrhythmias, including electrical storm, bilateral stellate ganglion blockade with lidocaine injection, and atrial fibrillation [60,61], and appears to be a suitable accompaniment to the blood measurements of catecholamines [8,61] in patients with TTS.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 15 (2022) 200152 6we engage further in the exploration of the mechanism(s) of the possible beneficial effects of obesity (or its particular phenotypes) in TTS, we should secure more evidence that, the prevalence of obesity (employing more sophisticated markers of obesity than the BMI) in patients admitted with TTS, is truly low.5.Conclusions Based on information from large databases/registries, the prevalence of obesity in patients with TTS is lower than the one in the general population, and this raises the possibility that obesity, or its particular phenotypes, exerts a preventive effect for the emergence of TTS, extents an ameliorating influence in the hospital course of afflicted patients, and reduces the rate of early readmissions.Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology, evaluation, and effect of weight loss: an update of the 1997 American heart 26 association scientific

Ogudu et al.This present study ex- tends the current body of knowledge by the fact that the chosen patient population is primarily African participants and it is an interesting development to observe a study with socio-culturally diverse mixed black African participants ’ background; as some of the previous similar studies [12,13,15,16,29,40,52–54] conducted in other regions of the world were carried-out amongst the white Caucasian patient population with some different genetic variability & phenotypic characteristics [12, 13,15,16,29,40,52–54].The community is made up of people from different parts of Nigeria.The screening of the community members to identify hypertensive individuals and the subsequent in- clusion of these hypertensive individuals in the present study took place at the Ajegunle Community Primary Health Centre.Study population and inclusion criteria The present study recruited and enrolled treatment naïve male and female adult individuals, aged F18 years with confirmatory diagnosis of hypertension from the organized community screening done and were residing within the Ajegunle community as at the time of this present research.Exclusion criteria The present study excluded hypertensive individuals who were already on antihypertensive drugs as at the time of this present study, pregnant women, breast-feeding women, individuals below 18 years of age, individuals with systolic BP F210 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP F 120 mm Hg, individuals with complications of hypertension including stroke, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertensive retinopathy and/ or renal impairment as at the time of initial presentation during recruitment contact for this study.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200144 4parallel-group study carried-out for 6-month at the Ajegunle Community between April 2018 and October 2018.These consented participants were randomly allocated into two different treatment arm groups of A and B; out of which 129 participants completed the 8 weeks follow-up visit.But 12 participants absconded during the follow-up visit period with no any known specific reason(s), while 1 participant was withdrawn from the study due to continuous and persistent elevation of her BP above the value of 210/120 mmHg not permitted or allowed for this present study despite antihypertensive combination therapy with both Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination (that is; antihypertensive drug resis- tance to both 20 mg of Lisinopril dihydrate and 12.5 mg of Hydro - chlorothiazide combination).Each study group treatment period lasted for 8 weeks duration and follow-up Fig.A Fixed-dose combination; B Separately administered combination.Efficacy and safety assessments The blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed at each follow-up monitoring visit.Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured after 15 min in resting state, at least two times (which were 5 min apart) in the sitting position.The respective blood pressure (BP) of each study participant was measured using validated manual analogue of the mercury sphygmomanometer by Accosons, England with appropriately sized cuff and Littman stetho - scope for listening to the referenced Korotkoff pulse sounds ’ phases for both systolic BP and diastolic BP at the cubital fossa region of the fore arm.Hypertension was defined in this present study as a resting state sitting position BP ≽140/ 90 mm Hg at baseline repeated on at least 3 different occasions of BP check and still found to be elevated above this stipulated cut-off point at the physician ’s office.The counts were performed at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8.Out of the 129 participants that completed the 8 weeks follow-up visit during this study; 67 (51.9%) were males, while 62 (48.1%) were females.The mean blood pressure of all the participants were 165.6 ±16.5 mmHg and 98.5 ± 11.5 mmHg for systolic BP and diastolic BP respectively, while the mean pulse rate of the participants was 85.0 ±13.4 beats/mins.There was an increase in prevalence of hypertension with increasing age in both male and female participants, with more males than females having hyper - tension except for the age group of 50–59 years, where more females had increased systolic and diastolic hypertension in both group A and B participants.The changes in the mean sitting BP values in the two treatment groups at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 are shown in Fig.Attaining goal BP and time to goal The proportion of patients in each treatment group who attained the treatment goals of D140/90 mm Hg was different.However, within each age group, there was significant reduction in blood pressure of the participants after drug treatments in the two groups A and B.4 shows the number of patients adhering to the two treatment regimens, while Fig.This finding is similar and consistent to the other previous reports that found the prevalence of hypertension to be higher in men compare to women [10,38].The apparent improvements in blood pressure levels associated with the use of fixed-dose combination therapy observed in this study may be a consequence of improved compliance with antihy - pertensive drug therapy.The drugs were effective in both groups with the fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy being more effective in getting more participants to the attainment of targeted blood pressure goal than the separately administered combination antihyper - tensive therapy.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200144 8Executive summary ≡In this study, the high prevalence of hypertension in Ajegunle Community reveals that there is unmet need in diagnosis and awareness of the disease.≡Pharmaceutical companies should make the antihypertensive FDCs of lisinopril –hydrochlorothiazide regularly available and affordable in the pharmaceutical drug market; so as to help many hypertensive patients to achieve their target BP control goals easily through the enhancement of proper adequate antihypertensive medications adherence/compliance process.Obi, An estimate of the prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria: a systemic review and meta-analysis, J.

2,A-systematic-review-comparing-cardiovasc_2023_International-Journal-of-Cardi.pdf,"This systematic review aimed to summarise and assess the quantitative evidence examining the association between providing informal care to others and CVD incidence in comparison with non-carers.On a global scale, informal care is estimated to account for 16.4 billion hours of unpaid care work each day [2].In contrast with paid care workers, informal carers typically have an existing relationship with their care recipient [9].For people who pro- vide care to a relative, prior studies have observed a ‘family effect ’ of caregiving [10].The quality of the relationship between informal carer and care recipient can also impact on the health of each person.One reported that the rela- tionship quality between caregiver and care-recipient was an effect modifier of the association between caregiving and CVD risk [22], and another found that caregiving for family members with dementia was a non-modifiable risk factor associated with CVD risk [23].A recent systematic review by Ahn et al. [24] explored both CVD incidence and risk amongst family caregivers of adults with chronic conditions.The review was restricted to full-text quantitative studies using any observational design that examined the association between informal care provision and CVD outcomes.Studies that examined CVD risk factors including hypertension and other subclinical outcomes or cardiovascular diseases that are not manifested via the stress pathway [20] such as congenital heart disease and rheumatic heart disease were excluded.As this review aimed to make a comparison between the CVD incidence between informal carers and non-carers, studies that did not include a non-caring comparator group in their analysis were also excluded.Two studies inferred the caregiving status of their participants based on a known relationship that participants had to an individual who had a specific disease, with one study exploring CVD incidence among spouses of cancer patients [30] and the other investigated CVD in household members of people with Alzheimer ’s disease [35].All but one of the other seven studies had participants self-report their caregiving status, with the remaining study examining caregivers who were identified by the care-recipient [31].Risk of Bias Assessment Across the nine included studies, the overall quality of the evidence assessing the association between informal car- ing and CVD incidence was judged to be at moderate to serious risk of bias (RoB).In contrast, Kim et al. [31] observed an increase in the odds of heart disease among long-term family caregivers of cancer patients, compared to participants who were providing care at baseline but had stopped caregiving at follow-up.Like- wise, the study by Miyawaki et al. [33] saw an increase in the risk of non-fatal CHD among family caregivers aged 50–59 years at baseline who provided more than 20 h of care per week, compared to non-carers.Self-reported non-fatal heart attack or stroke CVD-related death ascertained by proxy No association observed for incident CVD in women who cared for their spouses or parents compared to women who provided no caregiving.HR 1.20, 95% CI  [0.98, 1.47] There was an observed increase in incident CHD for caregivers who were aged F50 years (HR 1.28, 95% CI [1.01, 1.63]), married or cohabiting (HR 1.30, 95% CI  [1.04, 1.63]), or of low socioeconomic status (HR 1.38, 95% CI [1.07, 1.77]) compared to non-caregivers Ji (2012) Sweden Longitudinal 1,352,656 (spousal pairs) Spousal Caregiving Individuals who had children with and had lived for over 10 years with a person on the Swedish Cancer Registry were assumed to be spousal carers, they were identified using the Multi-Generation Registry Hospitalisation due to CHD or stroke, including haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke, identified with the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register At baseline (pre-cancer diagnosis), spouses of women with cancer had a slight increase in the standardised incidence ratio of CHD (SIR 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04]) and ischaemic stroke (SIR 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08]) compared to spouses of women without cancer.At baseline (pre-cancer diagnosis), spouses of men with cancer had reduced risk of CHD (SIR 0.88, 95% CI [0.86, 0.90]), ischaemic stroke (SIR 0.86, 95% CI [0.84, 0.89]), and haemorrhagic strokeSelf-reportedly receiving a physician ’s care or taking prescription medication for heart- related diseases including angina, CHD, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, heart attack, heart murmur, irregular heartbeat, and pacemaker In comparison to participants who were no longer providing care at the final follow-up, there was greater odds of heart disease for current carers, OR 1.12 (95% CI [1.03, 1.21]).Lee (2003) United States Longitudinal 54,412 (female Caregiving Status Self-reported yes/no answer to Self-reported non-fatal myocardial infarction was verified using There was no difference in the relative risk of CHD for participants (continued on next page) A.

(2018), Buyck et al. (2013), and Lee et al. (2003) [28,29,32] all reported both fatal and non-fatal CVD outcomes as a single outcome.In the two studies that made an inference about caregiving exposure status based on partici - pants ’ relationship to a person who was known to be ill [30,35], there is a risk of misclassification bias, as caregiving could not reliably be ascertained simply from the relationship used to allocate exposure sta- tus.In studies that used self-reported exposure status, biases may also have been present.Confounding may have also been a source of bias, with four studies failing to meet the minimal set of confounders imposed in this review.Examining these factors with a standardised definition of caregiving and accounting for participants who might move between caregiving and non-caregiving groups would improve the ability of future studies to infer the causality of the association between caregiving and CVD inci- dence.5.Conclusion The findings of our review highlight the need for more research to be conducted to explore the relationship between unpaid caregiving and CVD in greater detail.Distinguishing between fatal and non-fatal CVD outcomes may also serve to elucidate the nature of the relationship between CVD and informal care and help guide future directions for research.The findings of this review indicate that the association between providing informal care and the incidence of CVD is not clear, however, there is some evidence that CVD incidence is associated with more intense forms of informal caregiving.Screening of studies was conducted by the authors and an additional contributor, HMD.Heart Disease Risk for Female Cardiac Caregivers.Caregiver Stress and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Among Female Family Caregivers of Persons With Heart Failure.Wrong outcomes 5 Capistrant, B.D.et al.

5,Assessment-of-one-year-risk-of-ischemic-st_2022_International-Journal-of-Car.pdf,"Several guidelines to assess the risk of ischemic stroke and major bleeding in AF patients have been published.Methods: We incorporated the risks of ischemic stroke and major bleeding within one year of the index AF admission as well as the fear of stroke and bleeding of each individual patient.These es- timates were used in a Deming regression to model the association of ischemic stroke and major bleeding in grouped patients.This model for risk assessment of stroke and major bleeding within one year of the index AF hospital admission combined objective data and subjective assessment of the relative fear of stroke versus bleeding by each hypothetical patient on 0–100 scale.Conclusions: The new model for risk assessment of ischemic stroke and major bleeding within one year of the index AF hospital admission proposed in this work used objective, empirically driven measures, and subjective assessment of the outcomes ’ importance for individual patients.Patients with a score above a threshold (e.g., score ≽2 on the 0 to 9 CHA 2DS2-VASc scale) are recommended to take oral anticoagulation.The outcomes of ischemic stroke and major bleeding were combined into a single variable with levels corresponding to stroke only, major bleeding only, stroke and major bleeding, or neither of the outcomes within one year of the index AF admission.The latter is an errors-in- variables statistical model that accounts for errors in observations of both the risk factors and outcomes [10].The estimates of risks of the outcomes and the line of best fit from Deming regression are shown in Fig.The prediction intervals for stroke risk from the Deming regression model were used to construct the areas reflecting the level of concern, or fear, of a patient toward each outcome (stroke or major bleeding).If a patient belonged to a group represented by a point in the green region, the al- gorithm would recommend anticoagulation therapy (Fig.The group to which the patient belonged was therefore represented by a single point on the graph, with the risk of major bleeding on the X-axis, and the risk of ischemic stroke on the Y-axis.If, on the other hand, the patient was more Fig.The points correspond to patients grouped by the risk factors, with the size of the points proportional to the number of patients in each group.Groups of patients inside the green area are recommended to pursue anticoagulation therapy.4.Discussion In this study of patients with hospitalization for AF, we developed a novel approach to predict the risk of stroke and/or major bleeding within one year of index AF admission.The estimated proba - bilities for each group of patients (i.e., patients with the same combinations of demographic parameters and comorbidities) were then used as inputs to a Deming regression framework to model the risk of stroke versus the risk of major bleeding.The green area corresponds to the outcomes fear scores of 80–20 for ischemic stroke vs. major bleeding respec - tively.Since the point is withing the green area, the algorithm ’s recommen - dation for this patient is for anticoagulation therapy.Table 1 Patient demographic characteristics, diagnosis, and procedures, and outcomes (on or before index AF admission).A limitation of this study is the absence of medication and laboratory data in MIDAS, including information about anticoagulation therapy.Differences in the use of anticoagulation could influence the outcomes as patients with the same comorbidity profile could potentially have different outcomes based on background medical therapy within one year of index AF admission.Likewise, laboratory data could also further stratify patients and help to explain the outcomes.Cande Ananth: Conceptualization, writing, review and editing.Declaration of competing interest All authors declare: no support from any organization for the sub- mitted work;

6,Association-of-health-insurance-status-with-co_2022_International-Journal-of.pdf,"Keywords: Coronary heart disease Epidemiology Health insurance Social determinants of health Coronary interventions ABSTRACT Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) related hospitalization and interventions are associated with cata- strophic out-of-pocket health expenditure in India.Results: 4672 CAD patients (men 3736, women 936) were included; uninsured were 2166 (46%), government insurance was in 1635 (36%) and private insurance in 871 (18%).Mean age was 60.1 ±11 years, uninsured D50y were 21.6% vs 14.0% and 20.3% with government and private insurance.In-hospital mortality was slightly more in the uninsured (1.43%), compared to government (0.88) and privately insured (0.82) (p  0.242).Conclusions: Uninsured CAD patients in India are younger with more risk factors, acute coronary syndrome, STEMI, multivessel disease and coronary stenting compared to those with government or private insurance.It has been reported that existing health in- surance schemes can potentially cover 70% of the population and include government subsidized schemes, social health insurance schemes and private voluntary health insurance (Fig.Risk factor profile among the insured and uninsured patients is not known and no study has focused on differences in short- or long-term outcomes following PCI or direct financial costs in these patients.We enrolled successive patients un- dergoing PCI at our centre to determine influence of insurance status on CAD risk factors, type and severity of CAD, differences in interventional management, medical treatments, costs and in-hospital outcomes.2.Methods The Cath-PCI Registry at our hospital is part of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCDR) Centre of Excellence program [30].We also obtained data on co-payments from the insured patients.Incidence of in-hospital deaths was low (n  54, 1.0%) and similar in men and women.Among the uninsured there was higher prevalence of raised total and non-HDL cholesterol and tobacco use compared to other groups.Rates of pharmaco-invasive therapy were more in government insurance and uninsured patients (Fig.Details regarding coronary anatomy, interventions and outcomes among the uninsured, government and privately insured CAD patients are in Table 1.Prescription of hospital discharge medications were similar in the three groups.Compared to the uninsured, the total hospital costs for the government insurance patients were 11.7% lower and private insurance patients 10.1% lower (p D0.001).Studies among the uninsured in US and most developed countries have reported greater prevalence of CAD risk factors (smoking, hyper - tension, diabetes, poor quality diet, low physical activity, low socio - economic status), delayed presentation to health care systems, more severe disease at presentation, lower rates of coronary interventions and adverse cardiovascular outcomes at short-term as well as long-term follow-up [23,31].Our study shows greater risk factor burden and more severe coronary disease among the uninsured patients, similar to the data from other countries [32,33].Our study shows that even in a corporate hospital, that caters to middle and upper middle socioeconomic status patients, there is more severe disease along with delayed presentation among the uninsured.2.Management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients (n 1985) among the uninsured and in various insurance groups.Quality of healthcare provided to the uninsured is also important [42], and the present study shows a very low use of preventive therapies at admission.There is a need to more widespread debate on this issue as the US experience shows that lack of insurance is an important social determinant of health [33,38].However, the risk factor profile is similar to population based urban CAD patients in previous studies from India [2], and we believe that data are externally valid.On the other hand, this is one of the largest studies from India that have assessed CAD angiographic profile and PCI in the country and the only study that has correlated insurance status with the clinical features and outcomes and this is important.CREDIT statement Rajeev Gupta: Conceptualization, methodology, validation, investi - gation, data curation, writing original draft, review and editing, super - vision, project administration.[2]R.

2) resistance index (RI); and 3) pulsatility index (PI).Conclusion: Higher resistance and pulsatility indices measured on second trimester UAD were associated with increased odds of incident hypertension 2–7 years later, and may be biomarkers of higher maternal cardiovas - cular risk.UAD pa- rameters indicating decreased uterine artery compliance, such as persistence of a diastolic notch, higher resistance index (RI), and higher pulsatility index (PI), have been associated with APOs [17].Whether UAD parameters are associated with a higher maternal vascular risk profile following pregnancy is not known.For this anal- ysis, we included all nuMoM2b participants who had nuMoM2b protocol-related UAD studies performed at the second study visit be- tween 16 weeks 0 days and 22 weeks 6 days, and had complete follow up nuMoM2b-HHS in-person blood pressure measurements at 2–7 years after delivery.Participants with a diagnosis of chronic hypertension at time of enrollment in the initial nuMoM2b study, those with incident gestational and sustained post-partum hypertension, and those who were missing information for a hypertension diagnosis at follow up, were excluded from this analysis.We inves - tigated the following exposures of interest, all of which reflect poor uterine artery compliance [16]: 1) presence of an early diastolic notch in both UAD profiles; 2) maximum RI as a continuous variable; and 3) maximum PI as a continuous variable.Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics of the study population at the time of the index pregnancy were compared using t-tests for continuous variables, and Chi-square tests for categorical variables.In a pre-specified sensitivity analysis, we restricted the sample to participants who did not have a reported pregnancy between the end of the index pregnancy and the follow-up at 2–7 years after the index pregnancy.All statistical analyses are considered exploratory and are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.At the time of the follow up study visit, 187 of the 3739 participants (5 %) in this analysis were determined to have incident hypertension.Legend: This analysis included all nuMoM2b partici - pants who had UAD studies performed at the second study visit between 16 weeks 0 days and 22 weeks 6 days, and had follow up in-person blood pressure measurements at 2–7 years after delivery.Each 0.1-unit increase in maximum RI and PI was associated with higher odds of incident hy- pertension (RI, adjusted OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.03 –1.3; PI, adjusted OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.005 –1.05) (Table 2).Summary of results In this analysis of a prospective cohort of nulliparous people without baseline hypertension, we investigated whether second trimester UAD parameters indicative of reduced uterine compliance were associated with the development of maternal hypertension 2–7 years after the index pregnancy.Baseline characteristics at time of index pregnancy All participants (N  3739) Maternal age, years, mean (SD) 26.9 (5.5) Category (years): n (%) 13-21 757 (20.2) 22-35 2744 (73.4)25 to D30 912 (24.8) ≽30 841 (22.9) Systolic Blood Pressure at Visit 1, mmHg Mean (standard deviation) 109.1 (10.7) Median (interquartile range) 110.0 (100.0, 118.0) Diastolic Blood Pressure at Visit 1, mmHg Mean (standard deviation) 67.2 (8.4) Median (interquartile range) 68.0 (60.0, 72.0) Pre-gestational diabetes: n (%) 35 (0.9) Smoked during 3 months prior to pregnancy: n (%) 579 (15.5) Consumed alcohol during 3 months prior to pregnancy: n (%) 2304 (74.4) Adverse pregnancy outcome (APO): n (%) No APO 2901 (77.8 %) Any APO 829 (22.2 %) Gestational hypertension 499 (13.3 %) Preeclampsia or eclampsia 228 (6.1 %) Spontaneous preterm birth 185 (5.0 %) Iatrogenic preterm birth 112 (3.0 %) Small for gestational age (Alexander) 146 (3.9 %) Stillbirth 12 (0.3 %) Abbreviations: N sample size;

Patients treated with statins prior to the index hospitalization predating the CR intake, were signif - icantly older, with significantly greater comorbidity (diabetes, hyper - tension, history of myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident) compared to non-statin-treated patients.Another obstacle which could explain suboptimal lipid management is that prescribing physicians in our study underutilized the maximal tolerated doses for patients.HDL: Follow up 3 months (mean (sd)) 40.14 (10.41) 42.42 (11.09) 45.29 (10.92) 0.010 TG: Follow up 3 months (mean (sd)) 111.92 (72.99) 123.99 (62.14) 122.32 (52.34) 0.203 Medication by group (%)    0.385 atorvastatin ezetimibe 3 (0.9) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) rosuvastatin 56 (17.7) 28 (17.2) 6 (27.3) pravastatin 1 (0.3) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) atorvastatin 251 (79.2) 132 (81.0) 14 (63.6) simvastatin 5 (1.6) 3 (1.8) 2 (9.1) Dose (mg) of rosuvastatin (%)    0.160 5 1 (1.8) 4 (14.3) 1 (16.7) 10 12 (21.4) 4 (14.3) 0 (0.0) 20 23 (41.1) 7 (25.0) 3 (50.0) 40 20 (35.7) 13 (46.4) 2 (33.3) Dose (mg) of atorvastatin (%)    0.711 5 3 (1.2) 1 (0.8) 0 (0.0) 10 6 (2.4) 5 (3.8) 2 (14.3) 20 23 (9.2) 21 (15.9) 0 (0.0) 30 1 (0.4) 1 (0.8) 0 (0.0) 40 87 (34.9) 47 (35.6) 6 (42.9) 80 129 (51.8) 57 (43.2) 6 (42.9) Dose (mg) of simvastatin (%)    0.672 10 1 (20.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 20 3 (60.0) 1 (33.3) 1 (50.0) 40 1 (20.0) 2 (66.7) 1 (50.0) Dose or medication change during follow-up (%) 58 (19.6) 24 (14.8) 5 (22.7) 0.379 Reason for dose or medication change - follow-up (%)    0.001 Doctor decision 36 (57.1) 14 (56.0) 1 (16.7) LDL not at goal 3 (4.8) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Myalgia 21 (33.3) 5 (20.0) 1 (16.7) Patient decision 1 (1.6) 3 (12.0) 3 (50.0) Unknown reason 2 (3.2) 3 (12.0) 1 (16.7) *Presented data are based on patients with follow-up data only.Based on the results of our study and other global studies, it is clear that current treatments for lowering lipid levels are not optimal for a variety of reasons.Patients in our study were in a rigorous CR program, in one of the largest hospitals in Israel, with the most extensive and accurate recommendations on treatment upon discharge after hospital - ization.Despite all of these factors, most patients did not achieve the goals of lipid treatment, which were to reduce LDL levels D70 mg/dL (and even fewer patients achieved the latest recommended goals of reducing LDL levels D55 mg/dL).PCSK-9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to alternate LLTs [13].Holland, C.

[14], the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise International Database (FRIEND) [15], and McConnell and Clark [16].Since the walk/run transition was not known for each patient, and with the goal of maximizing the study sample size, the walking equation was used when test duration was ≼11.5min (30sec left of the stage at 4.2mph [6.8 km/hr]) and the running equation was used for a test duration F11.5min.Regardless of the equation used, the eCRF was higher in participants identified as living compared to deceased at the time of follow-up (P D0.05).As hypothesized, eCRF from each equation was predictive of all-cause mortality in patients with CVD.However, despite the differences in eCRF between the equations and Table 1 Summary of the equations used for estimating CRFa.Thus, regardless of the similar ability to predict all-cause mortality, these differences in eCRF equations suggest potential differences in their ability to guide clinical care.The eCRF from these non-exercise prediction equations is associated with mortality [21,23–25] but have errors in accuracy [12, 26,27], are less predictive of mortality compared to direct assessments of CRF [21], and do not allow for the collection of other metrics assessed during exercise testing that have clinical utility (e.g. exercising elec- trocardiogram and blood pressure).The strengths of the present study include the cohort of males and females with CVD and a diversity of clinical risk factors.The directly-measured CRF of the patients is not known and as a result it is not possible to determine which eCRF equation is most accurate in this cohort.However, the significant differences in eCRF values from each equation suggest potential differ - ences in their ability to guide clinical treatment plans and should be the focus of future prospective research.Blair, R.

in particular, those with numerically higher HRs were patient with age D75 years, paroxysmal AF, CHA 2DS2-VASc score ≽2, and without the use of PPI or H2 blocker.4.Discussion Our investigation presented that current smokers had significantly more ischemic events and ischemic stroke than the non–current smokers, but we found no significant difference in hemorrhagic events or mortality between the two groups.Smoking is well-known risk factor for both stroke and cardiovascular death in the general population [10].However, reports of smoking-related adverse events including stroke, thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death in patients with AF varied and there were no consensus [10].A: Ischemic events.Cigarette smoking is a well-known vascular risk factor [8].Although most guidelines recommend the use of DOACs as the first- line OAC, VKA is still used to prevent and treat arterial and venous thromboembolism [20,21].To date, VKA has been recommended for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve replacement or those with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis of the rheumatic origin, as well as in cases where the use of DOACs is limited by social conditions (such as financial constraints) or comorbidities (extreme weight and severe renal or liver disease) [21].Even former smokers have been found to fully recover within fifteen years or more after smoking cessation [1].In addition to the beneficial effect of smoking cessation on ischemic events, the adjusted HR of current smokers relative to non–current smokers for Fig.Therefore, we should encourage current smokers to quit and never smokers to maintain their abstinence in patients with AF as well [1].Therefore, the effects of current smoking in patients with AF may have been underestimated in our study.Fourth, although the SAMe-TT2R2 score is a simple score based on clinical risk factors (sex, age, medical history, treatment [interacting drugs, e.g., amiodarone for rhythm control], to- bacco and race), to distinguish patients according to low or high prob- ability of poor INR control (TTR D65%) [23], we were unable to calculate SAMe-TT2R2 score in this study because details of treatments were lacking.Because the change in OACs should reflect the risk assessment by physician, we considered such judgment would overwrite the effects of risk factor for events and lose the purpose of this study.Therefore, the effects of current smoking on hemorrhagic events in patients with AF on VKA should be investigated in the further studies.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200135 7showed a significant association between current smoking status and ischemic events or ischemic stroke.Further clinical studies are needed to explore the effect of smoking status on clinical outcomes in patients with AF.Credit author statement Hideki Arai: Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investi - gation, Writing – original draft, Visualization.;

There was no sig- nificant difference in the risk of end points in other DBP groups (all P F 0.05).4.Discussion In this retrospective cohort study of patients with HF, we examined the association between different BP levels and clinical endpoints 3 months after discharge, so as to explore the impact of the BP level on the short-term prognosis of patients with HF.Low BP (SBP≼90 mmHg, DBP≼55 mmhg) was associated with the worst prognosis.In addition to the significantly increased risk of heart failure rehospitalization due to high SBP (SBP F150 mmHg), it seems that higher BP has a better prognosis, and the risk of events is lower when SBP is between 90 mmHg and 150 mmHg and DBP is more than 55 mmHg.The patient population of these studies included the general population with Table 1 Baseline characteristics of HF patients divided by different systolic blood pressure levels.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 16 (2023) 200169 4hypertension, as well as those with hypertension complicated coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke/TIA, and the elderly [13].Unlike people with hypertension, the relationship between BP and the risk of adverse events seems to be more controversial and uncertain for people with HF.A meta-analysis assessed the association between SBP and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).Diuretic 969 (64.9) 42 (64.6) 225 (63.2) 390 (67.8) 259 (63.5) 53（60.2） 0.431 Digitalis 421 (28.2) 24 (36.9) 84 (23.6) 161 (28.0) 122 (29.9) 30（34.1) 0.082 Nitrate esters 934 (62.6) 36 (55.4) 206 (57.9) 361 (62.8) 275 (67.4) 56（63.6） 0.063 Table 1，Table 2：SBP: systolic blood pressure;

Niu et al.[ 8]Although the populations of the above studies are different, consistent with our results, they all support that higher BP in patients with HF has a better prognosis.The results showed that there was a reverse J-curve relationship between BP and the risk of all-cause death in patients with HF.The lowest risk value (point J) SBP/DBP was 132.4/74.2 mmHg respectively, of which the lowest risk value of HFrEF was 136.0/76.6 mmHg, HFpEF is 127.9/72.7 mmHg.Although there is an increased risk of death from low or high BP, the risk of death from low BP is greater [10].Compared with this study in Korea, although our study has a short follow-up time and focuses on the short-term prognosis of hospitalized patients with HF after discharge (followed up for 3 months after discharge), we also observed a reverse J-curve relationship between BP and clinical endpoint events in patients with HF.The possible mechanism of worse prognosis in HF patients with hypotension in this study is speculated to be related to the following factors.In addition, in this study, the BP of patients is the BP at discharge.The relationship between the dy- namic evolution of BP and the prognosis of patients with BP, especially the impact on the long-term prognosis, needs to be further observed.Stough, M.

[11] did not exclude cocaine users with histories of concurrent cannabis or alcohol use, making it difficult to rule out these factors as it relates to our findings.Increased cocaine-use frequency during the past month and cocaine- use chronicity (years of regular use) both significantly predicted longer QTc intervals; yet, these two factors explained only 2.3% of the variance, after controlling for effects of other predictors (higher BMI, male sex, less past-month cannabis and tobacco use) that explained 10.4% of the variance.While evaluating individuals who present with chronic use of heroin and/or cocaine, it is important to recognize that cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol may also exert significant effects on cardiovascular function, and that use of these common substances could overshadows the effect of illegal drugs on cardiovascular outcomes.5.Conclusions Cardiovascular disease has been increasingly linked to regular use of substances such as cocaine and heroin.Al- Khatib, et al., Race and gender variation in the QT interval and its association with mortality in patients with coronary artery disease: results from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease (DDCD), Am.[36] M.

P D0.001) and 8-oxo-dG (P 0.047).In particular, the combined interaction between moderate levels of ethanol exposure and the ratio of dietary omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids is an important understudied area of research because n-3 fatty acids appear to provide car- dioprotective benefits that overlap with those of moderate ethanol consumption [15,16].Experimental studies indicate that supplementa - tion of n-3 fatty acids may lower cardiovascular risk by improving lipid profile, blood pressure, endothelial function, and inflammatory markers [17].The ratio of n-6:n-3 dietary fatty acids in Western diets has markedly increased over the last century, which has been associated with increased inflammation and risk of many chronic diseases [21].The objective of this study was to examine the effects of moderate ethanol consumption and dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid composition on markers associated with cardiovascular disease and liver dysfunction in mice.It was hypothesized that moderate ethanol consumption in com- bination with a balanced (1:1) dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids may result in potential additive protective effects on lipid and inflammatory markers associated with CVD, whereas a high (50:1) n-6:n-3 diet may by contrast antagonize any beneficial effects of moderate ethanol exposure on physiological indicators of CVD risk.The latter blood alcohol levels approximate 0.02 –0.06% in humans, or that normally resulting from 1 to 2 standard drinks [26], corresponding with the current definition of moderate or ‘low-risk ’ drinking as defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 –2020 [27].Trolox was used as a standard and absorbance was read at 405 nm.Body weight gain, food intake, and fluid intake There were no significant differences in either initial body weight or Fig.1.Mean (±SEM) body weight, fluid intake, and food intake over time in control and ethanol-exposed mice consuming the high n-6 or balanced n-3 diet.(A, B) Two-way Fluid (2) x Diet (2) factorial ANOVAs revealed no significant differences in either initial body weight or final body weight between groups.However, analysis of weight gain indicated that regardless of diet, control mice gained more weight than ethanol-treated mice over the course of the experiment (main effect of Fluid: F1,19 6.03, P  0.02).(C,D) Fluid intake was greater in control mice than ethanol-treated mice during all weeks except Week 1 (main effect of Fluid: F1,19  222.34, P D0.001; main effect of Week: F14,266  59.98, P D0.001; Fluid x Week interaction: F14, 266  37.52, P D0.001).Blood glucose and lipid profile Glucose levels were significantly lower in the control group compared to the ethanol group, regardless of diet (main effect of Fluid: F1,19 6.69, P 0.018; Table 1).HMGB1 was also significantly lower in the ethanol group compared to the control group (main effect of Fluid: F1,19 7.95, P 0.011; Fig.The oxidative marker 8-oxo-dG was significantly lower in ethanol-exposed mice compared to controls (main effect of Fluid: F1,19 6.61, P 0.019) and in mice consuming the n-3 diet compared to the n-6 diet (main effect of Diet: F1,19 4.50, P 0.047; Fig.In combination, concurrent intake of moderate levels of ethanol together with the n-3 diet resulted in further decreases in 8-oxo-dG, as well as trends toward lower levels of triglycerides and LDL.There was a trend toward lower TG in the ethanol group compared to controls (P 0.066) and a trend toward lower LDL within the ethanol group in mice consuming the n-3 vs n-6 diet (P 0.062).The present study found reductions in both ALT and AP resulting from moderate alcohol consumption; however, an increase in AST:ALT ratio was also observed.Heavy ethanol consumption and binge drinking are associated with an increase in blood glucose and consequently an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome [44,45].The current study found increased plasma glucose in ethanol-exposed mice, although prior studies have indicated possible benefits in glucose metabolism and lowered blood glucose from mod- erate alcohol consumption [12,46].(C) The n-3 diet resulted in significantly higher TAC compared to the n-6 diet (main effect of diet, P D0.001; NS effect of fluid, P 0.310; NS interaction, P 0.407).Each group was comprised of 3 male and 3 female mice, except the Ethanol n-3 group which contained 3 male and 2 female mice.Finally, the results of the present study should be interpreted within the context of observed differences in fluid and food intake between ethanol-exposed and control mice which resulted in a significantly greater body weight gain in the control group compared to the ethanol group.Further studies are also needed to better understand the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on liver function including histology and additional parameters of oxidative stress, as well as blood glucose and insulin sensitivity including a glucose tolerance test with assessment of glucose stimulated insulin secretion, given across-study variation in these measures.(A) There was an interaction of fluid and diet on AST levels (main effect of fluid, P 0.006; fluid x diet interaction: P 0.017; NS effect of diet, P 0.304).Regardless of diet, ALT (B) and AP (C) were significantly lower in ethanol-consuming mice compared to controls (main effects of fluid: P 0.002 and P 0.021, respectively).Each group was comprised of 3 male and 3 female mice, except the Ethanol n-3 group which contained 3 male and 2 fe- male mice.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200132 7administered a higher dose of alcohol, will allow for within-study comparison of the effects of moderate vs. excessive alcohol exposure on key measures of interest.Mukamal, et al., Moderate alcohol consumption and chronic disease: the case for a long-term trial, Alcohol Clin.[8]G.

Al-Rousan et al.CVD risk by sex was only reported by Bo et al. Interestingly, both refugee men and women had a higher incidence of CVD than other immigrants from the same countries of origin when analyzing country of birth and migration status simultaneously.However, compared to native populations, only refugees from certain countries had a higher CVD risk by sex.Second, we found that many studies reported (and interpreted) regression coefficients for all included variables (e.g., age) while the primary exposure of interest was refugee status.Additionally, the underlying mechanisms explaining the increased CVD risk in refugees have been investigated in some of the studies included, but more research is needed to explain these risk patterns.Norredam et al. adjusted for only age and sex, while Bo et al. found income to be a potential explanation for the increased CVD risk in refugees.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 12 (2022) 200126 6migration-specific characteristics, including pre, during, and post-migratory variables including access to care and length of stay in the resettlement country, are needed to establish causality and quantify risk.Although this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on CVD risk among refugees, the generalizability and validity of our study are limited.Given that most of the world ’s refugee population resides in low- and middle-income countries where the as- sociation between low socioeconomic status and CVD incidence and CVD mortality are high [40], research endeavors and infrastructure must be strengthened to study refugees in these countries.Roberts, Forced migration: the human face of a health crisis, JAMA 314 (20) (2015) 2125 –2126, https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2015.14906 .Aldridge, D.

out of these, 934 (45.09%) were women.All patients who had underwent coronary angiography were included in the case group in case of the obstruction equal to or above 75% in at least a single coronary artery or left main ≽50%, while patients with normal coronary arteries were included in the control group.In addition, the frequencies of statin use and LDL control were compared between the two groups (sex and ethnicities).The information on the statin use and LDL control for the sex group is shown in Table 3 and Fig.Among different ethnicities, Arab and Gilak patients had the highest and lowest proportions of the controlled LDL in all four types of statins, respectively, compared with Fars participants (Fig.After adjustment for other variables except HDL, TC, TG, and BMI (Model 3), the odds of LDL control in Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin were 0.73 (0.55, 0.97), 0.73 (0.55, 0.97), and 0.73 (0.55, 0.96), which remained significantly lower in women than men.Followed by adjustment for age in the ethnicity group, the odds of controlling LDL by taking Lovastatin in Gilak, Arab, and Lor were 0.52 (0.66, 0.32), 7.14 (25.2,1.53), and 0.45 (0.02,1.07), respectively (Table 5).As shown in Table 5, the odds of controlling LDL in Gilak patients were less than those in Fars patients.After adjustment for other factors (full model), compared with Fars patients, the LDL control still exhibited a statistically significant decrease among Gilak 0.36 (0.25, 0.53) and a significant increase among Arab 4.63 (17.28, 0.73) patients.In the full-adjusted model (Model 4), the odds of controlling LDL for Gilak was 0.63 (0.48, 0.74) lower and for Arab was 4.55 (17.03, 0.71) higher than that for Fars.Atorvastatin (529a) Lovastatin (1871a) Rosuvastatin (1783a) Simvastatin (1914a) Male Female  Male Female  Male Female  Male Female NLDL-C controlled / n 130/controlled 63.7% 70.3% 0.126 75.8% 69.7% 0.004 74.9% 68.7% 0.05 75.8% 69.9% 0.005 % Statin use 27.4% 27.5% 0.610 97.4% 96.7% 0.549 92.7% 92.3% 0.147 99.4% 99.4% 0.556 Models  OR (95%CI) P  OR (95%CI) P  OR (95%CI) P  OR (95%CI) P 1 1 (ref) 1.19 (0.77,1.84) 0.427 1 (ref) 0.76 (0.59,0.97) 0.026 1 (ref) 0.75 (0.59,0.96) 0.024 1 (ref) 0.76 (0.60,0.97) 0.027 2 1 (ref) 1.24 (0.77,2.01) 0.377 1 (ref) 0.72 (0.55,0.96) 0.024 1 (ref) 0.72 (0.54,0.95) 0.021 1 (ref) 0.73 (0.55,0.95) 0.021 3 1 (ref) 1.07 (0.65,1.77) 0.771 1 (ref) 0.73 (0.55,0.97) 0.028 1 (ref) 0.73 (0.55,0.97) 0.029 1 (ref) 0.73 (0.55,0.96) 0.027 4 1 (ref) 1.08 (0.64,1.84) 0.761 1 (ref) 0.82 (0.60,1.11) 0.211 1 (ref) 0.81 (0.60,1.11) 0.192 1 (ref) 0.82 (0.61,1.11) 0.208 1: adjusted by age sex.2: model 1smoking and activity.3: model 2 cornice disease, family history of stroke or heart attack, and history of chronic heart disease (CHD).1.Percentage of statin consumption and LDL control by Sex.In the cases of Rosuvastatin and Simvastatin, only the results obtained from Gilak and Arab participants were significant and the chance of controlling LDL in the Gilak and Arab patients was lower and higher than that in Fars patients, respectively.The results of the present study revealed that females had lower odds of controlling LDL-C than males in the cases of Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin groups; however, no significant difference was observed regarding Atorvastatin.With the exception of pita vastatin, variations of statins response between Asians and Westerners were observed for all statins in Ref.Another study demonstrated that a lower dose of statins in the Japanese people would allow for a relative reduction in the risk of contracting CVDs similar to the case of a higher dose of statins among Western people [15–17].Lee et al. stated that in comparison to white patients living in the same milieu, Chinese, Asian-Indian, and Table 5 Odds Ratios among those taking lovastatin , LDL control (LDLD100) across Race groups.Our findings revealed that in the Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin groups, females had a lower chance of managing LDL-C than men; however, there was no significant difference in the Atorvastatin group.On the contrary, some researchers have found that statins taken by women, compared to by men, would result in a significant reduction in both LDL-C and TC [28,29].Vree et al. stated that the hydrolysis of Lovastatin was greater than that of Simvastatin.The reason that no difference between ethnicity and gender was observed for Atorvastatin compared to other statins is probably because a fixed dose of statins can create different concentrations in different races and this is due to differences in genes and as a result of drug metabolism, excretion and absorption.Females had lower chance of LDL-C management by statins than males regarding the Lovastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin groups, except for Atorvastatin.Authors would like to acknowledge participants who took part in the study and staff of Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Institute.[3]K.

30,Even-chained-acylcarnitines-predict-long-term-c_2022_International-Journal-o.pdf,"We explored metabolites from the carnitine pathway as predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) - and all-cause mortality among patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD).Associations with CVD- and all-cause mortality were assessed by multivariable Cox regression models.Serum acetyl, octanoyl- and palmitoylcarnitine predicted CVD mortality with multivariable HR and 95% CI (per SD increment log transformed) of 1.36 (1.01 –1.83), 1.49 (1.15 –1.93) and 2.07 (1.49 –2.85), p ≼ 0.04, respectively.Hence, a majority of patients with chest pain and non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) may have impaired function of the epicardial coronary arteries or microcirculation [1].Excessive as well as dysfunctional mitochondrial FA oxidation (FAO) have been impli - cated in the pathogenesis of several lifestyle related diseases and may be mirrored by elevated circulating acylcarnitines [6–12].We previously demonstrated that high levels of serum acylcarnitines predicted increased risk of CVD mortality and future acute myocardial infarction among patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), of which the majority had obstructive CAD [16].In the present study, these 8 metabolites were evaluated in relation to long-term risk of CVD- and all-cause mortality risk among patients with NOCAD.Information on SIS was available in 764 (73%) of the patients.Since we were particularly interested in the relations of carnitine metabolites to CVD risk in NOCAD patients, we defined CVD mortality as the primary endpoint.Correlations of carnitine precursors and metabolites with important clinical baseline characteristics have previously been reported for the source population (n 4164) [16] and similar associations were found S.K.TML, acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine were positively correlated with age (rho 0.12 –0.20, p D0.001).With the exception of TML which showed a weak positive association (rho 0.13, p D0.001), the carnitine precursors and esters were not associated with diastolic blood pressure, nor were they significantly correlated with the SIS, LVEF or EDP (rho ≼0.07, p ≽0.06).Baseline levels of carnitine precursors and metabolites in relation to mortality during follow up During median (25th, 75th percentiles) 14.1 (13.2, 15.4) years of follow-up, 60 (5.7%) of the study participants died from CVD and all- cause mortality occurred in 181 (17.3%).Palmitoylcarnitine was the only metabolite providing a significant increment in ROC-AUC for CVD mortality (Δ0.030, p 0.03).Palmi - toylcarnitine also improved risk classification for CVD- and all-cause mortality as well as increased model discrimination for CVD mortality.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200134 4 Fig.1.Kaplan-Meier curves showing unadjusted cumulative incidence of clinical events according to quartiles of serum acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarntine and palmitoylcarnitine.Reported p-values are for the corresponding log rank tests.S.K.Storesund et al.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200134 5 Fig.2.Dose –response relationship between serum acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarni - tine and risk of clinical events during follow-up ob- tained by generalized additive regression.The models are adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, estimated GFR, HbA1c, apoliprotein A1, apolipoprotein B and fasting status.The solid lines show the HR and the shaded areas show 95% confidence intervals.Ranges from the 2.5th to the 97.5th percentiles of exposure variables are included.In cross sectional studies, elevated levels of plasma long-chained acylcarnitines were found in patients with obesity [30], insulin resistance [31], and type 2 diabetes [32].Acyl- carnitine profiles have also been linked to increased risk of CVD mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes [6], possibly mirroring a cardiotoxic accumulation of FAs due to an insufficient FAO.Increased levels of palmitoylcarnitine have been associated with adverse prognosis among patients with heart failure [33].We previously demonstrated that high levels of even chained acylcarnitines predicted increased risk of CVD mortality and future acute myocardial infarction among patients with CCS, of which the majority had obstructive CAD [16].In the present study, we found no significant risk association between the precursor TML and adverse outcomes.Funding The study was funded by the Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organisation, the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, the Western Norway Regional Health Authority and the Department of Heart Disease, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.E.R.P., G.F.T.S., and O.K.N.and E.

32,Exercise-training-for-cardiovascular-_2022_International-Journal-of-Cardiolo.pdf,"As a mystical formula of invocation or incantation, the “physical activity is a cornerstone of cardiovascular (CV) prevention ” mantra (or an equivalent concept) is systematically recited by cardiologists and other clinicians when approaching patients at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD).This is obviously derived from a large amount of evidence and solid recommendations focusing on the protective role of physical activity against CV morbidity, mortality, and disability, so even during routine consultations and patient contacts physicians and allied professionals are encouraged to promote exercise in all patients [1,2].That is a crucial step, due to the importance to precisely defining the perimeter of “moderate ” or “vigorous ” efforts in primary/secondary prevention, and mostly to prescribe a desired training volume (i.e. the equation having intensity, session time, and number of sessions as factors) to CVD patients.The reliable determination of these thresholds is given by the nadir of ventilatory equivalents (VE/ VO2 and VE/VCO2) to work rate relationships and may be applied to the majority of CVD patients.This clear indication will help clinicians to implement tailored and individualized training programs (at least in healthy persons, this approach leads to a significantly lower risk of ‘non- responding ’ to exercise intervention), but it largely depends on the availability of CPET at a local level, as far as on being patients fit enough to perform an incremental test, and finally on the possibility to evaluate both VT1 and VT2 (not always guaranteed in markedly deconditioned patients).The intensity of dynamic resistance/strength training is usually referred as percentage of one repetition maximum (1RM, i.e. the maximum weight a patient can lift in one complete repetition) and the best way to assess it is by use of a dynamometer.As a general advise supported by the position statement, the progression of exercise dose should ensure the maintenance of prescription goals, should be really individualized and include all the FITT components.[6]M.

long-term residence in Canada was associated with a higher prev- alence of cardiovascular risk factors [9]; migration to Australia was associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic diseases [10].The first consideration is that these countries are characterized by different habits and lifestyles from those of the Mediterranean area.The present study was therefore designed to examine the association between residence time in Italy and major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a first-generation Chinese immigrant community.Each participant received the results of all clinical and biochemical tests undergone, with a clear statement of whether the diagnostic criteria for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia were met or not.General characteristics of the study population Overall, 2589 participants in the CHIP study (1599 women and 990 men), born in the provinces of Zhejiang (80%), Fujian (12%), or Liaoning (5.2%) were included in the analysis.Cardiovascular risk factors and length of residence in Italy When the studied population was stratified according to the time of residence in Italy, differences in hypertension and diabetes were evident (Table 1).In the overall Chinese population, the prevalence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes increased whereas hypercholesterolemia was found to decrease with the length of residence in Italy (Table 2).In particular, the present results rely on measured rather than on self- reported data and indicate 3 main points: the length of stay in Italy is associated with a progressive increase in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes independently of the age of the subjects; second, an effect of gender is markedly evident, because changes almost exclusively affect the female population; third, in women residency in Italy is associated with favorable changes in diet composition with a reduction of high cholesterol and overweight/obesity.However, the rural origin was not associated with the development of obesity, diabetes, or with qualitative changes in diet as evidenced by the Mediterranean Diet score.In the present study overweight and obesity were found to increase with length of residence in Italy only among Chinese men.Although information is limited for the Chinese population the obesity risk was also reported to increase among the Chinese population both in the U.S.A [26].Characteristics 1–9 years (n 900) 10–19 years (n 1351) 20–32 years (n 338) p * Age categories 16–29 years 112 13.5% 45 3.7% 3 1.2% 0.001 30–39 years 199 24.0% 193 15.8% 18 7.2% 40–49 years 303 36.5% 451 37.0% 62 24.7% 50–59 years 216 26.0% 531 43.5% 168 66.9% Gender (Women) 553 61.4% 820 60.7% 226 66.9% 0.110 Origin (Rural China) 638 71.0% 976 72.5% 274 81.5% 0.001 Education categories No studies 58 6.7% 107 8.1% 30 9.0% 0.001 Primary/ Secondary School 391 45.0% 719 54.3% 201 60.2% High School 386 44.5% 469 35.4% 88 26.3% College or higher 33 3.8% 30 2.3% 15 4.5% Health insurance categoriesIn the present study adherence to dietary recommendations, expressed using the Mediterranean Diet score, was also found to increase with length of residence in Italy only among women.F2 Risk Factors OR (95% C.I.)1.75 (1.52 –2.03) 1.38 (1.15 –1.66) 0.80 (0.67 –0.96) – – – – Length of residence 1–9 years 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 10–19 years 1.16 (0.92 –1.45) 1.56 (1.15 –2.14) 0.73 (0.57 –0.95) 0.83 (0.69 –1.01) 0.96 (0.79 –1.17) 0.83 (0.65 –1.07) 1.59 (1.06 –2.37) 20–32 years 1.85 (1.33 –2.58) 1.62 (1.05 –2.51) 0.52 (0.33 –0.83) 0.87 (0.65 –1.18) 0.91 (0.66 –1.26) 1.18 (0.79 –1.78) 2.09 (1.28 –3.42) TC Total cholesterol;

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, BRFSS; Body mass index, BMI; Cardiovascular disease, CVD; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; Coronary heart disease, (CHD); National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES; National Health Interview Survey, NHIS.2.Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using publicly available data from the NHIS, which is a nationally representative health survey that has been serially performed by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [14].In this study, we included 99,864 participants with history of hypertension and available self-reported race/ethnicity data from NHIS 2006 –2018.We calculated and showed annual prevalence of hypertension for individuals younger than 50 years by race/ethnicity from 2006 to 2018.Among White and Asian American individuals with history of hypertension, 25.4% and 27.1% were younger than 50 years old, respectively.Among patients with hypertension, prevalence of hypertension among those younger than 50 years old (mean age, 38.6 ±0.1; 43.3% women, 85.6% US born) was significantly higher for Asian Indians (37%) as compared with Chinese (21%) (P D0.001).In univariate and multivariable analyses (adjusted for sex, education, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, and CHD) using White in- dividuals as the referent category (Table 2), Chinese individuals younger than 50 years old had lower likelihood of history of hypertension, compared with Whites as the reference in both unadjusted (OR 0.78, 0.64 –0.96) and multi-variable adjusted models (aOR 0.79, 0.63 –0.98).Asian Indians had higher likelihood of history of hyper - tension among those less than 50 years of age in unadjusted (OR 1.69, 1.38 –2.08), and adjusted models (aOR 1.85, 1.48 –2.31) compared with White individuals.Among Asian American populations, women (aOR 0.68, 0.55 –0.83) and individuals with a history of diabetes (aOR 0.35, 0.26 –0.46) and coronary heart disease (aOR 0.30, 0.20 –0.47) had a lower likelihood of diagnosis of hypertension younger than 50 years of age.Education level higher than college (aOR 1.96, 1.61 –2.38) and current smoking (aOR 1.60, 1.16 –2.20) were associated with higher likelihood of diagnosis of hypertension younger than 50 years of age.On the other hand, Asian Indians had consistently higher prevalence of hypertension among individuals younger than 50 years old than all other participants (Supplementary Figure 1-D).4.Discussion Results from this study showed that Asian Indian and ‘other Asians ’ individuals have higher prevalence of reported hypertension among individuals younger than 50 and 40 years old, when compared to White or Chinese populations.Likelihood of premature hypertension was higher for Asian Indians, Filipinos, and ‘other Asians ’ compared with Chinese individuals in models that did not include White individuals in the analyses.A BRFSS study that combined data from 2013, 2015, and 2017 survey years showed that prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 21% among non-Hispanic Asians and 34% among non-Hispanic Whites [18], which is similar to our study.In this study, we showed higher likelihood of diagnosis of hyper - tension at an age younger than 50 years old among Asian American individuals with higher than college education and those with a known diagnosis of diabetes or CHD.This is consistent with a previous study including a Filipino American population from eight community-based organizations that showed higher education level was associated with a higher likelihood of diagnosis of hypertension in Filipino individuals, 80% of whom between the ages of 46–65 years were reported to have Table 2 Regression analyses evaluating the association between various Asian groups and prevalence of hypertension at age less than 50 years old among National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) participants (White race as the referent group).Overall, findings from this study and prior literature support that higher health awareness is associated with higher likelihood of diagnosis of ASCVD risk factors, such as hypertension, at an earlier age.Prior studied have reported worse CHD risk factor profile among Asian Indians as compared to other racial/ethnic groups.‘Other Asian ’ population in this study were found to be more likely to have premature hypertension than Whites and Chinese individuals.The cross-sectional nature of the NHIS survey limits the definition of premature hypertension using age of diagnosis due to recall bias.Under-representation and small sample size of some Asian populations did not allow for a more granular assessment of the racial/ ethnic minorities that may be at higher risk of premature hypertension.Benziger, Global burden of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, 1990–2019: update from the GBD 2019 study, J.Islam, Clinical characteristics and lifestyle behaviors in a population-based sample of Chinese and South Asian immigrants with hypertension, Am.[10] S.

however, only two prior studies examined women separately.No significant association was found between hsTnI and BAC.Besides its use in the acute setting, a body of epidemiological research [4–9] supports the utility of hsTnI for cardiovascular risk stratification among asymptomatic populations.The association of BAC with hsTnI has not been investigated.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention u{�~zkw!Cohort description MINERVA (MultIethNic study of brEast aRterial calcium gradation and cardio VAscular disease) is a large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women.In brief, eligible participants were female active members of Kaiser Per- manente of Northern California (KPNC) between the ages of 60 and 79 when they attended regular mammography screening at KPNC between 10/24/2012 and 2/13/2015.For budgetary reasons, 3000 women who attended the clinic visits and had available stored blood samples were randomly selected for the MINERVA Bio- markers sub-study that the current study is based on.1 details the consort diagram of cohort se- lection.A new validated densitometry Non-standard abbreviations BAC Breast arterial calcification CAC Coronary artery calcification CAD Coronary artery disease CHD Coronary heart disease CVD Cardiovascular disease ASCVD Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease CI Confidence Interval PCE American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Pooled Cohorts Equation NRI Net reclassification improvement cNRI Clinical net reclassification improvement MINERVA MultIethNic study of brEast aRterial calcium gradation and cardio VAscular disease KPNC Kaiser Permanente of Northern California MLO Mediolateral oblique CC Craniocaudal ICD-9 International classification of diseases 9th revision ICD-10 International classification of diseases 10th revision CPT4 Current procedure terminology, 4th edition PPV Positive predictive value SD Standard deviation SBP Systolic blood pressure DBP Diastolic blood pressure LDL Low density lipoprotein HDL High density lipoprotein BMI Body mass index HsTnI High sensitivity troponin I Hs-CRP High-sensitive C-reactive protein BNP Brain natriuretic peptide EF Ejection fraction HFpEF Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFrEF Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Fig.The validity of the event ascertainment using codes and underlying cause of death has been reported elsewhere [23].Age-adjusted rates per 1000 person-years of CHD, ischemic stroke, heart failure (and heart failure types) and all CVD were estimated according to hsTnI levels using Poisson regression with right-censoring at death or termination of health plan membership (n 441; 15.2%).In heart failure models, BNP was also entered as a covariate in Model 2.The inde- pendent association of hsTnI with BAC (also at different thresholds) was assessed using logistic regression with minimal and full adjustment as implemented in the CVD outcome analysis.After a mean (SD) follow-up of 7.4 (1.7) years, 51 CHD, 30 ischemic stroke and 46 heart failure events were ascertained.When hsTnI was entered as a standardized continuous variable, the fully-adjusted hazard ratio varied between 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09 –1.52; p 0.003) for heart failure and 1.31(95% CI, 1.15 –1.50; p D0.0001) for CHD.In the fully-adjusted model, hsTnI F10 ng/L (relative to D4 ng/dL) was associated with 25-fold significant increased hazard of HFrEF (p 0.0001).The C-index, a measure of discrimination, for the model containing only PCE risk was 61.7 and it significantly increased (Δ C-index 6.5; p 0.02) to 68.2 after adding hs-cTnI categories.The gains in reclassification were mostly driven by up-risking of women with high levels of hsTnI.We found that adding hsTnI to a ASCVD model containing the PCE resulted in significant and clinical important improved calibration, discrimination and reclassification, supporting the utility of hsTnI as a biomarker for CVD risk stratification in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.Our analysis failed to detect an association between hsTnI levels and BAC, suggesting that subclinical myocardial ischemia is not likely to be etiologically linked to BAC.Because of size (small to medium) and biology, breast arteries are comparable to epicardial or microvascular circulation and distinct from large vessels such as the coronaries or the aorta.In conclusion, our analysis in a large, ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal demonstrates that hsTnI is independently related to incident CVD and its components, CHD and ischemic stroke as well as heart failure, particularly HFrEF.hsTnI (ng/L) Coronary Heart Disease (n  51) Ischemic Stroke (n  30) Heart Failure (n 46) All (n 116) Hazard Ratios (95% CI);

SARS-CoV-2 might utilise this increase to result in severe disease A [6] Severely ill male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a higher risk of death B [7] The use of ACEI and/or ARBs can increase the risk of severity of COVID-19 A [8] Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension, and malignancy predispose individuals with COVID-19 to adverse clinical outcomes A [9] Does not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic B [10] A significant difference in the use of ACEI/ARB among patients with different severities of the disease B [11] ACEI/ARBs reduce IL-6 and increase CD3 and CD8, thus reducing COVID-19 severity; ACEI and ARBs are beneficial in COVID-19 A [12] AT1R blockers, including ARBs, can help reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality A [13] Animal data: increasing ACE2 expression can help protect against pulmonary and cardiovascular hazards; recommend continuing the use of ACEI and ARBs to manage hypertension in COVID-19 patients A [14] RAAS inhibitors were shown to be possibly associated with a lower risk of mortality B [15] Fig.A deficiency of lung ACE2 may worsen systemic diseases, such as hypertension, due to induction of peripheral vasoconstriction, pro-inflammatory reactions, and oxidative stress (Fig.There is an increasing likelihood of admission of patients with pre- existing hypertension with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to non- hypertensive patients [26].Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of hypertension and obesity is 50% and 48%, respec - tively.(5) Assembling of the proteins and RNAs into a new virion in the Golgi.ACE2 converts AngII to Ang1-7, which acts on the Mas receptor leading to vasodilation and lung pro- tection.For instance, IL-6, which has been strongly connected to clinical outcomes of COVID-19, appears to be a significant regulator of immunologic and inflammatory reactions in hypertension [33].It has been shown that hypomethylation of IL-6 is related to a higher risk of developing essential hypertension in matched case-control studies with patients and healthy controls of the same ages and gender [35].In COVID-19, there is noteworthy activation of T and B cells with an exaggerated immune response that leads to severe complications due to higher release of pro-inflammatory cytokines with the development of cytokine storm [41].Therefore, hypertension by delaying SARS-CoV-2 clearance may increase COVID-19 severity and related complications.Notably, elderly patients are at increased risk for COVID-19-related complications; ageing is also an established risk factor for developing hypertension.Taken together, both obesity and hypertension are interre - lated in the development of COVID-19 severity due to impairment of immune response, pro-inflammatory status, and coagulation/pro - thrombotic disturbances that trigger more severe complications in hy- pertensive COVID-19 patients with obesity [61].Likewise, activated NF-κB signaling pathway in SARS-CoV-2 can induce activation of node-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is also stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1β [64].Therefore, there is a mutual relationship between hypertension and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Regarding the effect of antihypertensive drugs that modulate RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs, Yun et al., [69] study involved 476 hyperten - sive COVID-19 patients showed that ARBs users illustrated a less severe form of COVID-19.A meta-analysis included 33,483 COVID-19 patients from 11 studies illustrated no significant increment in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 –1.05] in patients receiving ARBs/ACEIs therapy [72].Therefore, hypertension is not a potential risk factor in COVID-19, and the associated risk of hypertension is related to its confounding effect on diabetes mellitus.One interesting study involving 112 COVID-19 patients with hypertension on ARBs illustrated that ARBs was not linked to morbidity and mortality [86].The expression of ACE2 may also be up-regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR- ɣ) and rosiglitazone (a PPAR-ɣ agonist), which have also been demonstrated to increase the expression of ACE2 [89].Zhang et al., [91] observed that telmisartan, an AT1R blocker, also exerts stimulation in PPAR-ɣ pathway leading to anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive effects.The present study hypothesized that hypertension contributes to a complex effect with other comorbidities on mortality in COVID-19 patients.[15] C.

Magnani* Division of Cardiology, UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USAKeywords: Coronary heart disease Antiplatelet therapy Social determinants ABSTRACT Objective: To investigate the relation of annual household income to antiplatelet adherence following PCI.Our results indicate the importance of considering social risk factors in the evaluation of barriers to antiplatelet adherence following PCI.Adherence with DAPT is crucial to improving cardiovascular outcomes following coronary intervention [3].Using a large database of de-identified health and pharmacy claims, we investigated the relation of household income to antiplatelet adherence in individuals with who underwent PCI.Adherence was then categorized as either adherent (PDC ≽80%) or non-adherent (D80%).Clinical covariates were defined by ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes in inpatient or outpatient claims prior to or at time of PCI.As a sensitivity analysis, we excluded individuals with prevalent coronary artery disease defined as prior MI, PCI, or CABG to investigate for differences in risk by income level.Our cohort included individuals with mean age 69.0 ±10.9 years; 33.1% women; majority white race (74.9%) with 9994 (11.1%) Black, 9786 (10.9%) Hispanic, and 2896 (3.2%) Asian individuals, as summarized in Table 1.Healthcare utilization as measured by number of cardiology visits in the six months following PCI was similar across income categories with median number of 3, and enrollment time (25th, 75th percentile) following PCI was 20 (11,31) months for the cohort and did not differ substantially across income categories.We observed a graded decrease in proportion of days covered with decreasing income as represented by kernel density plot (Fig.In the full cohort, 97% of days were covered with P2Y12 antiplatelet agent pharmacy fills (median PDC of 97%).We noted progressive decrease in 1st quartile PDC across income categories with PDC 84% in the highest income category (≽$100,000) and PDC of 77% in the lowest income category (D$40,000).PDC decreased with decreasing income level for each antiplatelet medication while overall PDC of our cohort did not differ in a clinically meaningful way between the antiplatelet medications.Specifically, we observed an inverse relation between household income and likelihood of antiplatelet adherence.The association of lower household income with decreased odds of antiplatelet adherence remained significant even after multivariable adjustment and did not vary significantly by anti- platelet medication prescribed.Non-adherence to medical therapy is pervasive across a myriad of chronic diseases and has been associated with increased mortality in cardiovascular disease [20].A subsequent study of the cohort found that among patients who had DES implanted, 1 in 7 pa- tients were no longer taking DAPT by 30 days, which was associated with increased mortality for the next 11 months (7.5% vs 0.7%, p D 0.001) [21].Household income D$40,000 $40-In both Viet- namese and Israeli cohorts, low income was associated with decreased adherence to antiplatelet therapy after PCI [30,31].In contrast a U.S. cohort study of non-white patients who underwent PCI demonstrated that income did not predict adherence to antiplatelet medications [32].Household income was categorized as D$40,000, $40–49,999, $50–59,999, $60–74,999, $75–99,999, and ≽$100,000.Table 2 Proportion of days covered across income categories by medication in cohort with percutaneous coronary intervention, 2017 –2019.$75k- D$100k 1.19 (1.13,International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200140 6Antiplatelet therapy is standard of care after PCI and recognizing risk factors and barriers to antiplatelet adherence is vital to providence quality care to patients.Incorporation of social risk factors such as income in the electronic health record paired with by structured implementation of previously recognized successful interventions, may be a means of improving an- tiplatelet adherence following PCI.6.Conclusion In conclusion, in a retrospective analysis of a large U.S. health claims database, we observed a significant association between household in- come and antiplatelet adherence in individuals who underwent PCI.Bittl, et al., 2016 ACC/AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology/American heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines: an update of the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary intervention, 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 2012 ACC/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes, and 2014 ACC/AHA guideline on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, Circulation 134 (10) (2016) e123 –e155.O’Neal, et al., Association of household income and adverse outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation, Heart 106 (21) (2020) 1679 –1685 .Conn, The effectiveness of medication adherence interventions among patients with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis, J.

40,Inflammatory-cytokines-differ-between-patients-wi_2022_International-Journal.pdf,"Previous data showed that patients in SR with high CHA 2DS2-VASc score have higher plasma levels of inflammatory markers such as sP-selectin and C-reactive protein.The PLF4 cytokine blood level was measured by ELISA.This score is currently used in daily clinical practice to assess the risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and guide the use of anticoagulation treatment [2].AF further produces an inflammatory reaction that promotes atrial remodeling as well as AF persistency and progression [7,8].In addition, elevated levels of inter- feron gamma (IFN-ƴ) were shown to be an independent risk factor of stroke and all-cause mortality in patients with new-onset AF, and IFN-ƴ levels had an incremental prognostic value supplementary to that ob- tained from the CHA 2DS2-VASc score [9].In the current study we further investigated the underlying mecha - nism of higher risk of stroke in patients at SR and high CHA 2DS2-VASc scores, compared to patients with low scores, by a systematic compari - son of serum cytokines between the two groups.The patients were enrolled from cardiology or internal medicine departments and from cardiology outpatient clinic at our medical center between March 2018 and December 2020.Statistical analysis The results are presented as the mean ±standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables with normal distribution, as median with inter- quartile range-IQR (25th; 75th percentiles) for continuous variables with abnormal distribution, and as number and percentage of total pa- tients for categorical data.Of them, 23 patients (35%) had high CHA 2DS2-VASc score, and 43 (65%) had low CHA 2DS2-VASc score.TNF- α concentrations were significantly different between CHA 2DS2-VASc score 3 and CHA 2DS2-VASc score  4 [median 9.61 (6.66, 9.76) vs. 13.05 (9.70, 14.92) pg/ml respectively, p 0.038] and between CHA 2DS2-VASc score 3 and CHA 2DS2-VASc score 7 [median 9.61 (6.66, 9.76) vs. 18.41 (15.62, 19.22) pg/ml, respectively, p 0.015].The differences in TNF- α between the groups were dependent on age and CHF (p value D0.05) and were not dependent on sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, IHD and history of CVA or CRF.TNF- α levels were mainly dependent on age and history of CHF.The group of patients with high scores also had a trend toward higher levels of cytokines IL-1β and IL-8, compared to the group with low scores.This cytokine is produced by activated macrophages as a proprotein, which is proteolytically processed to its active form by caspase 1 (CASP1/ICE).Men, n (%) 26 (39.4) 11 (47.8) 15 (34.9) 0.31 Diabetes Mellitus, n (%)b 10 (15.2) 8 (38.4) 2 (4.7) 0.002 Dyslipidemia, n (%) 31 (47.0) 22 (95.7) 9 (20.9) D0.001 Hypertension, n (%) 27 (40.9) 21 (91.3) 6 (14.0) D0.001 Smoking, n (%)b 9 (13.6) 6 (21.6) 3 (7.0) 0.04 Ischemic Heart Disease, n (%)b 13 (19.7) 13 (56.6) 0 (0) D0.001 Stroke, n (%)b 6 (9.1) 6 (26.1) 0 (0) 0.001 Peripheral Artery Disease, n (%)b 1 (1.5) 1 (4.3) 0 (0) 0.35 Chronic Heart Failure, n (%)b 7 (10.6) 7 (30.4) 0 (0) D0.001 Chronic Renal Failure, n (%)b 4 (6.1) 4 (17.4) 0 (0) 0.01 Permanent Pacemaker, n (%)b 5 (7.8) 4 (18.2) 1 (2.4) 0.04 Sick sinus syndrome, n (%)b 3 (4.6) 2 (3.1) 1 (2.4) 0.28 Laboratory tests Hemoglobin (g/dL), mean ±SD 13.6 ±1.5 13.4 ±1.5 13.8 ±1.5 0.40 Platelets (103/dL), median (IQR)a 239 (201,287) 230 (196,279) 243 (210,306) 0.36 Creatinine (mg/dL), median (IQR)a 0.9 (0.7,1.0) 0.9 (0.9,1.3) 0.9 (0.7,1.0) 0.40 Echocardiographic parameters LVEF, %, median (IQR)a 60.0 (50.0,60.0) 60 (43.8,60.0) 60 (60.0,60.0) 0.14 LA diameter, mm, median (IQR)a 3.9 (3.2,4.4) 4.3 (3.8,4.5) 3.2 (3.0,3.9) 0.002 LA Area, cm2, median (IQR)a 20.6 (16.0,24.0) 22.6 (19.0, 28.3) 15.0 (12.2,21.0) 0.002 SPAP, median (IQR)a 30.0 (23.5,39.0) 26.2 (20.3,31.9) 26.0 (21.5,27.0) 0.01 Treatment Statins, n (%) 27 (41.5) 21 (91.3) 6 (14.3) D0.001 Beta blockers, n (%) 16 (25.0) 15 (65.2) 1 (2.4) D0.001 ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, nIL-8 is an important protein related to inflammation, where it plays a key role in the recruitment of neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection [8].These three cytokines were found to be elevated in the group of patients with SR and high CHA 2DS2-VASc score in the current study.TNF- α, IL-1β and IL-8 are all secreted from macrophages following in- duction by sP-selectin [29], a factor that was found to be increased in this group of patients in our previous work [21].It plays a crucial role in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory and hem- orrhagic sites, and it also affects cytokine production by leukocytes [29, 30].There is accumulating evidence that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in addition to traditional risk factors such as arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia, even in pa- tients with no AF [31,32].Yet, the difference in the level of inflammatory markers between the groups directs to the underlying mechanism of the worse prognosis in patients with high CHA 2DS2-VASc.Lip, U.

The data for 462 successful recordings were available for analysis.Diurnal variation in heart rate We checked for differences in recording length, proportion of missing values, proportion of weekend and weekdays and mean activity level across age, sex, ethnicity, education, occupation and income proxy groups.The amplitude is the height of the cosine curve, calculated as the difference between the midline and the peak; this represents the degree of diurnal variation in HR.As physical activity could thus affect the measurement of circadian parameters, we chose to repeat our subgroup analyses after exclusion of individuals with an average high activity level.Levels of high physical activity, a potential determinant of diurnal rhythm parameters, differed across sociodemographic variables, with higher levels in lower education and occupation categories, while the opposite was observed for income proxy.Supplement 1a shows the mean heart rate per 2 h in the study sample, demonstrating a clear diurnal rhythm with the trough between 04:00 and 06:00 and the peak between 12:00 and 14:00.The peak time was an hour later in the lower and intermediate occu- pation level groups (14.1 h) compared to the lower occupation level group (13.1 h), while this differed by less than 0.7 h in education level groups and less than 0.4 h in income proxy groups.When considering only weekdays (Table 3, column 2), there were also no substantial differences in amplitude across SES groups.The amplitude of the diurnal rhythm in heart rate did not appear to differ substantially, consistently or statistically significantly across SES groups.We found significant differences in the midline across income proxy groups, with higher values found in each lower income proxy group compared to the highest income proxy group.All days Weekdays only Amplitude Mesor Acrophase Amplitude Mesor Acrophase Education level Higher 11.0 (4.0) 76.7 (7.8) 13.6 (7.3) 11.3 (4.4) 76.9 (7.8) 12.8 (7.9) Intermediate 10.7 (4.3) 77.4 (9.6) 13.4 (7.6) 11.4 (4.9) 77.7 (9.6) 11.3 (9.4) Lower 10.4 (3.8) 72.0 (7.9) 14.1 (6.3) 10.6 (4.3) 72.2 (8.1) 12.8 (8.1) Occupation level Higher 10.8 (4.0) 76.4 (7.6) 13.1 (7.7) 11.1 (4.2) 76.5 (7.8) 12.3 (8.5) Intermediate 11.5 (4.6) 77.6 (8.4) 14.1 (6.5) 12.4 (5.3) 77.9 (8.2) 12.3 (8.1) Lower 9.5 (3.3) 71.7 (7.5) 14.1 (6.4) 9.7 (4.1) 71.9 (7.8) 12.6 (8.5) Income proxy Higher 10.6 (4.2) 73.2 (7.9) 13.5 (7.1) 10.5 (4.5) 73.3 (8.0) 12.9 (7.8) Intermediate 10.5 (3.9) 76.1 (9.6) 13.9 (6.8) 11.1 (4.5) 76.4 (9.7) 11.8 (9.1) Lower 11.1 (3.8) 76.9 (8.0) 13.7 (7.2) 11.7 (4.5) 77.0 (8.2) 12.6 (8.1) The amplitude is the difference in heart rate from the midline of the cosine wave to the peak.The Acrophase is the time of the peak in the cosinor models.Other autonomic activity markers such as heart rate variability and blood pressure are associated with low SES, although it is unclear if this is also the case for HR [3–6].Thus, a raised midline in the diurnal variation of HR may be expected to be associated with low SES.5.Conclusion We observed a clear diurnal rhythm in HR in all SES groups.This may suggest that the diurnal rhythm of HR does not contribute to the known SES differences in CVD morbidity and mortality.The HELIUS study is also funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation, the Netherlands Organization Table 4 Mesor and acrophase of the cosinor models by education level, occupation level and income proxy, adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity.[2]A.

strategies.However, the scientific basis of therapeutic interventions using conventional understandings of the disease mechanisms has been subject to renewed scrutiny with novel findings in recent years.This critical review attempts to revise the pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis using a recent body of literature, with a focus on lipid metabolism and associated cellular and biochemical processes.At present, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is the leading cause of the global incidence of heart attacks and is a major contributor to many peripheral vascular diseases [1–4].This short review attempts to revise the pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis using a body of recent literature spanning 2012 –2022 with a focus on lipid metabolism, and summarizes current and upcoming therapeutic strategies to address them1.2.Pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerosis and ACVD The term atherosclerosis is derived from the Greek word for ‘gruel ’ or ‘porridge ’, reflecting the yellowish appearance of the lipid material found in the core of a typical atherosclerotic plaque or ‘atheroma ’.Subsequent mediator release by PBMC in the intima promotes smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and initiates atheroma growth.Along with lipid particles, these cellular masses accumulate to form a necrotic fibro-fatty lesion core, which leads to further inflammation and obstruction of arterial flow.(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Following the initial lesion formation, SMCs produce a plethora of extracellular matrix (ECM) mediators including elastin, collagen and advanced glycation end products (AGE) which collectively facilitate the thickening of the intimal layer and disruption of arterial hematody - namic activities.In this study, a more focused outlook on the major biomolecular compartments suggests a set of interconnected metabolic and physio - logical processes that drive the genesis and evolution of atherosclerosis as a pathology.These compartments can be largely divided into two major areas: a) upstream processes leading to atherosclerotic lesion formation (direct and indirectly associated with lipid oxidation), and b) downstream magnification of atheroma and thrombosis (immune infil- tration, cytokine storms, thrombus formation).Unsaturated fatty acid oxidation products or free radical lipid per- oxides accumulating in LDL particles drive the production of pro- inflammatory aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA) – which activate the migration and foaming of macrophages4 [4].4 Foam cells are circulating macrophages that localize to fatty deposits on blood vessel walls that uptake LDLs/ox-LDLs and obtain a foamy appearance.These metabolites have been reported to have primary roles in local inflammatory signaling, vascular permeation, epithelial dysfunction, and vasoconstriction [14,15,21].CYP proteins, on the other hand, have a diverse set of roles and produce different lipid epoxides and hydroly - sates.However, PTGS and arachidonate LOXs themselves are subject to indirect modulation by upstream mechanisms of serum lipid and LDL-C level regulation.However, while important to cholestrol metabolism, both PCSK9 and LOX1 are yet to be fully understood in both endpoint effect and direct underlying molecular mechanisms in atherosclerotic plaque develop - ment.PUFAs trafficked across the cell membrane enter into the cytosol and are subsequently degraded by lipoxygenase (LOX), epoxygenase (CYP450) or cyclooxygenase (PTGS) pathways.In contrast to stable PUFAs which generally exist as lipoproteins in conjunction with antioxidants (e.g.: Apolipoprotein a/b), LOO*s are highly unstable and cross biological barriers, which leads to further propagation of oxidant radicals into the cellular domain, and conse - quently, activation of the stress response and inflammation pathways [15,20,21].Phospho - lipids are another source of LOO* generation that undergo LOX- mediated/non-enzymatic oxidation to produce 4-HNE products.Hence, a fine balance is required between a necessary cellular ROS level, and harmful accumulation of free radicals which can lead to dysregulation of redox homeostasis as depicted in Fig.NOXs are highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and act as a potent source of H2O2 generation as well as PBMC recruitment in atherosclerotic Fig.These oxidized products have roles in cellular metabolism and signaling but at high concentrations lead to atherogenic complications.However, with exogenous/systemic sources of free radicals, these failsafe mechanisms are easily overrun and/or depressed by LOX/PTGS metabolic products along with transition metal oxidizers [10].During erythrocyte hemolysis, free Fe3in circulation acts as a strong redox agent, which results in the subsequent oxidation of LDL.These theories of free radical mediated generation of atherosclerosis have prompted the development of antioxidant and metal ion-chelating, small molecule drugs, which are further discussed in section 2.2.Routine recycling of erythrocytes and hemolytic stress induced by ROS and extracellular signaling leads to release of free iron ions into circulation, which are either taken up by PMBCs, or act as non-enzymatic oxidants of LDL-C/ PUFAs.Macrophagic iron is also essential in catalytic activation of the iron-dependent peroxidation enzymes, LOXs, PTGSs, and thromboxane A synthase (TXAS), and subsequent downstream enzymes including platelet activation by protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), resulting in pro-atherogenic pathway activation and atheroma progression.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200143 7lipoxidation-relevant modes of oxidative damage, other mechanisms of oxidation have been excellently overviewed elsewhere [10].This interjecting area is as con- voluted as the underlying metabolic system itself with contradicting evidence that hinders the proper therapeutic targeting of a multi-pathway approach to management of ACVD, hyperglycemia/DM, obesity, and associated disorders therewith.5.Role of Glucose Metabolism in ACVD Development.A) Representative time course of changes in plasma glucose levels and its effect on inflammatory trends show effects of glucose uptake on lipoxidation and endothelial dysfunction in ACVD [Adapted [6]]; B) Enzymatic degradation of polysaccharides by digestive enzymes leads to increased glucose abundance and subsequent direct/indirect ROS stress in progressing atheroma.However, the causal effect of inflammatory and immune response leading to increased glucose uptake and energy homeostatic dysregulation is yet to be fully elucidated.The study provides new insights into an overlapping realm of overnutritional stress, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and the dysfunctional immune sys- tem in ACVD.Ito reviewed the entangled realm of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, ROS, and arterial atherosclerosis, and found that therapies that stabilize glucose levels also reduce oxidative stress in patients with DM.Insulin resistance provoked by hyperglycemia and obesity also converges with inflammation and immune modulation in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/MAPK/Akt/PI3K and Nf-Κb/IL-1 β/TNF- α/IFN- γ pathways [34].An overview of the current understanding of the glucose abundance impact on ACVD is illustrated in Fig.As a result, inflammatory mediators form the signaling basis for recruiting circulating immune cells, which in turn, propagates inflammatory signaling and hyperactivation of stress-responsive pathways in cardiac/arterial SMCs and endothelial cells.A systematic review by Meng explored the role of chronic stress in inflammation, lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunc - tion, hemodynamics, and blood pressure, plaque stability, autophagy, ferroptosis, and cholesterol efflux – all acting as direct modulators of initial and advanced atherosclerotic lesions [35].LDL-C oxidation products were also found to downregulate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR- γ) and the scavenger enzyme, platelet glycoprotein 4 (CD36) [29].The downstream interactions of lipoxides with immune cells and resulting pathway modulations are illustrated in Fig.Role of the thrombotic cascade and hemostasis in atherosclerosis While ox-LDL and peroxides set into motion a complex set of chemical reactions to promote inflammation and proliferation, thereby leading to intima thickening and atherosclerotic clot formation – the later stages of atherosclerosis, and by extension atherothrombosis, is driven by the interplay among inflammation, platelet function, and hypercoagulability.Classical coagulation pathways converge to a common thrombin-activated fibrinogenic clot formation, which is regulated by a set of serine proteases or coagulation factors.Global market for atheroprotective therapeutics The global prevalence of ischemic heart disease has increased from about 100 million in 1990 to over 180 million cases in 2019 [7].Available therapeutics: progress and shortcomings While the field of ACVD and atheroprotective medicine is rich with decades of R&D as well as industrial incentives – Libby reprimands current therapeutic interventions that have largely been ineffective, unsafe and/or underperforming in significantly affecting atherosclerotic events in clinical trials [3].However, several trials using different ω-3 fatty acids have reported contradicting evidence in atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease management [3,10,12,40].Notable candidates for immune-modulation and inhibition of inflammatory processes include antioxidant vitamins, probucol/succinobucol, canakinumab, tocilizumab, colchicine, methotrexate that reduces CrP and IL levels, and NSAIDs such as celecoxib and zileuton that reduce PG synthesis and lipid peroxidation products [3,7,10,18].Drug Class Prominent Examples Primary Mechanism of Action Reference/ Review Antioxidant Vitamins Ascorbic Acid, α-Tocopherol, β-Carotene Free radical scavenging and antioxidation [10] Metal Chelators Edaravone, Carvedilol, Hydralazine, Free radical scavenging and reduction of metal ion availability [15] Antiplatelets Aspirin, Warfarin Inhibition of platelet activation and atherothrombosis [3] β-Blockers Atenolol, Propranolol, Bisoprolol etc.As a result, to date, no natural preparations have been proven safe or efficacious enough to be incorporated into atherosclerosis-associated human trials.Another avenue currently being explored for effective management of atherosclerosis is the glucogenic compartment of the disease and targeting the DM-CVD synapse [7].Another avenue of peptides in cardioprotection manifests in the form of peptide hormones – particularly natriuretic peptides with substantial anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative benefits in ACVD [12,46,48].These miRNAs can construct a rich reservoir of potential atheroprotective candidates that can a) target/inhibit ACVD regulating genes/proteins, b) activate/upregulate expression of anti-inflammatory and/or anticoagulant factors in disease networks, and c) replenish or mimic endogenous miRNA expressions.A collection of recent evidence in miRNA therapeutic development in ACVD and relevant diseases has been provided in Table 4.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200143

upper panel Fig.A total of 64 adverse clinical events (death, n 59; nonfatal MI, n 5) occurred in the propensity score-matched patients during follow-up.Patients with adverse clinical events had a significantly greater number of diseased vessels, a lower HDL cholesterol level, were more likely to have a history of MI, prior PCI, PAD, NYHA class II–IV disease, an LVEF D40%, to be current smokers, and were less likely to receive OMT, an ACE/ARB, or a statin (Table 2).Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed that the probability of adverse clinical events was lower in the OMT group (n 202) than in the sub- OMT group (n 202), which is similar to the results obtained for all the study patients (p 0.02, log-rank test;

Svingenb, Eva KR.Keywords: Physical activity β-blocker therapy Stable angina pectoris Mortality ABSTRACT Background: Physical activity (PA) influences sympathetic stimulation, platelet activation as well as vascular function, and has been associated with improved health outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease.β-blocker therapy reduces sympathetic activity and improves platelet and endothelial function.Compared to the patients who were sedentary or inactive, the age and sex adjusted HRs (95% CI) for all-cause mortality were 0.89 (0.66 –1.20), 0.73 (0.57 –0.95) and 0.72 (0.55 –0.95) in the low, moderate and high PA group, respectively.Conclusions: In patients with suspected SAP, increased PA was associated with reduced mortality risk primarily in patients treated with β-blockers.We therefore investigated the association between self-reported PA and risk of all- cause mortality in a large cohort of patients with suspected SAP, with a particular focus on potential effect modifications by β-blocker treatment.Because β-blockers have been shown to improve sur- vival in patients with HFrEF [9,10] and in patients with AMI [11,12], we excluded patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) D40% and patients with prior AMI, as well as those with missing baseline PA data, yielding 2284 subjects eligible for the present study.Survival analyses were carried out with Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the relationship between PA as an ordinal vari- able and all-cause mortality, using the inactive/sedentary group as reference category.The proportion of patients prescribed β-blocker therapy did not differ according to PA groups.Among patients receiving β-blockers, PA showed a graded and strong inverse association with all-cause mortality (HR [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.60 –1.20], 0.65 [0.47 –0.89] and 0.58 [0.41 –0.81] in low, moderate and high PA group, respectively in age and sex adjusted model).PA, and baseline characteristics PA is reported to have several physiological effects which are beneficial for cardiovascular health [1].PA, β-blockers and mortality The mortality benefit from β-blocker treatment in patients with HFrEF and in patients with acute myocardial infarction has been re- ported in landmark trails [9–12].Patients with angina Table 1 Baseline characteristics according to self-reported physical activity levels.Value Groupsa Inactive/ sedentary Reference  Reference  Reference Low 0.89 (0.66- 1.20) 0.44 0.85 (0.63- 1.15) 0.28 0.86 (0.64- 1.17) 0.34 Moderate 0.73 (0.57- 0.95) 0.02 0.71 (0.55- 0.92) 0.01 0.71 (0.55- 0.92) 0.01 High 0.72 (0.55- 0.95) 0.02 0.72 (0.54- 0.95) 0.02 0.71 (0.54- 0.94) 0.02 Trend 0.89 (0.81- 0.97) 0.01 0.89 (0.81- 0.97) 0.01 0.88 (0.81- 0.96) 0.01 Model 1 was adjusted for age, and sex.Model 2 was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, angiographic extent of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, estimated glomerular filtra- tion rate, atrial fibrillation, and total cholesterol.In a British cohort of male patients, PA was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality [5].Accordingly, we observed an inverse association of PA with platelet count, described as risk factor for mortality [38] and fibrinogen, an important determinant of platelet aggregation/adhesiveness [36], further corroborated by re- sults from the British Regional Heart Study among 3810 male subjects with and without CVD [21].Notably, the predominant β-receptor antagonistic effect is observed during high SNS stimulation [13], which is supported by our observation of the lowest mortality risk with higher PA among β-blocker users, and no apparent survival benefit in those not taking β-blockers.Thus, the protective effect of PA may be stronger in β-blocker users due to more severe coronary artery disease or due to β-blocker therapy itself or combination of both.5.Conclusions In patients with suspected stable angina pectoris, we observed an inverse association between higher physical activity and risk of all-cause mortality primarily among those prescribed β-blocker therapy.Gard FT.

SBP, systolic blood pressure; IHD, ischemic heart disease; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DALYs, disability-adjusted life years.One approach to addressing poor adherence could be the use of single pill combination (SPC) therapies to reduce the pill burden faced by patients with hypertension.These include: 1) single drug with dosage titration first, then sequential addition of other agents (start low and go slow), which has been the most widely used strategy (and continues to be so by a large number of doctors and national health systems in countries with low and medium incomes) since it was recommended in its “stepped care” variant by JNC- 1 in 1977 and the first ESC/ESH guidelines in 2003; [13,14] 2) free choice combination with multiple pills, which was implicit as a possi - bility for the second step in the traditional guidelines and was recently indicated by the 2020 ISH guidelines as an essential option when single pill combination therapy is not available; and 3) combination therapy in the form of a single pill, which is indicated preferentially from the first step of the current treatment by most of the guidelines currently accepted in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and it has been included since July 2019 by the WHO in the list of essential medicines [15].The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes associated with different treatment pathways, including SPC therapies in line with ESC guideline recommendations, for the man- agement of hypertension.In the absence of long-term randomized controlled trials directly comparing these strategies, a simulation modeling approach was used based on the best available data to eval- uate the long-term outcomes in patients with hypertension in five countries (Italy, Russia, China, South Korea and Mexico).Different adherence rates were used for single and multi-pill regimens in each country based on published data (see Supplementary Material ).The lowest absolute values were projected for Russia and China, and these settings were also where the biggest relative increases in patients reaching target SBP were noted, with SPC increasing the number of patients reaching target SBP by 28% relative to CTP in both of these countries (Fig.The greatest reductions were projected for the Italian setting, with SPC reducing the incidence of clinical outcomes by 11.5% versus CTP.FCC (9.6%) and SLGS (7.2%) were also associated with substantial reductions in the incidence of clinical outcomes versus CTP in Italy.The reductions in the 10-year incidence of clinical outcomes versus CTP in this setting were 4.9% for SPC, 3.7% for FCC and 1.6% for SLGS.Reductions in clinical outcomes led to corresponding reductions in DALYs with SPC, FCC and SLGS regimens versus CTP (see Supple - mentary Material ).International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 10 (2021) 200102 4FCC and SLGS regimens, are likely to improve blood pressure control and consequently reduce the risk of clinical events and associated DALYs and mortality relative to the current standard of care.Improved adherence with SPC therapies was a key driver in the analysis, leading to SPC being associated with the greatest benefits relative to CTP.These observations were true across all five country settings.It is noteworthy that two treatment approaches, SPC and FCC, were associated with the greatest improvements in SBP in the modeling analysis, with improved adher - ence on SPC therapy providing an additional benefit over FCC.Despite this, the prevalence of hypertension has remained largely unchanged over the last two decades, primarily due to the sub-optimal use of antihypertensive drugs.For example, a value of 0.409 would be the equivalent of 40.9% of the population being adherent in any given year, with adherence defined as ingestion of ≽80% of prescribed blood pressure medication.However, reviewing the simulation parame - ters and their role in the simulation may offer a likely explanation of differences in key outcomes.As with all modeling studies, the present analysis was not without limitations.Whilst the large number of simulated patients could be considered a strength of the present study, the modeling analysis made no distinction between patients with mild hypertension (SBP D150 mmHg) for which monotherapies might have been enough and patients with moderate or more severe hypertension for whom combination therapy was clearly indicated.5.Conclusions The present analysis provides evidence that, based on 10-year pro- jections of clinical outcomes associated with different antihypertensive treatment pathways, combination therapies (FCC and SPC) are likely to reduce the disease burden of hypertension compared with conventional management approaches.Rubio-Guerra, Combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension, Drugs Context 7 (2018) 212531 .Report of the Joint National committee on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure: a cooperative study, J.Kulikoff, et al., Population and fertility by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1950 –2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, Lancet 392 (2018) 1995 –2051 .[23] S.

p D0.02) and AUR levels in overall hypertensive population (r 0.30; p D0.001) (Fig.Since the well-established data of role of aldosterone excess in heart failure, as far as higher cardiovascular complications in PA, recent ef- forts were addressed to acknowledge the pivotal act of aldosterone in subclinical damage in the early stages of hypertension.In our study specifically conducted on asymptomatic patients with brief history of hypertension, we have found significant increase of “worsening age” phenomenon in PA patients respect to EH.Furthermore, presence of PA was significantly associated with increases in backward and forward wave amplitude, independently of age, PWV and BP [29].Peripheral and central PWV were significantly higher in PA patients compared to EH patients, while clinical BP were similar, sug- gesting that PAC was the main predictor of cf-PWV in PA.As regard, we have shown that different pa- rameters obtained by PWV are altered in PA patients respect EH patients, matched for blood pressure load, using well standardized technique, carried out with dedicated software.While APA patients had significantly higher DBP, PAC, c-IMT and heart-ankle PWV compared to EH patients, it was observed a reduction of c-IMT, brachial-ankle PWV and heart-ankle PWV, one year after adrenalectomy.Moreover, Holaj et al. have examined the long-term impact of PAC on c-IMT in a cohort of 42 patients affected by PA, highlighted that both surgical and medical treatment were effective in regression of common carotid IMT, even though the effect was more pronounced after adrenalectomy than after spironolactone therapy [33].While there was a decreased trend in 24-h systolic and diastolic BP values, in the multivariable analysis, no statistically significant inter- action was found between time and PWV (for any outcomes), suggesting that PWV has low sensitivity and specificity to predict therapeutic response.In multivariate linear analysis of all hy- pertensive subjects, 24-h urinary excretion of μ-albuminuria has been seen as stronger predictor for main parameters derived by the evaluation of arterial stiffness parameters (augmentation index, SEVR, arterial stiffness index, travel time of the reflected waves).International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200138 7The specific treatment of PA, through reduction of renal damage and μ-albuminuria, as well as reduction of pleiotropic effects of aldosterone excess on cardiovascular and metabolic systems, could explain reduction of altered arterial stiffness parameters in hypertensive patients with subclinical vascular damage due to aldosterone excess.As regard, it would be interesting to expand our APA and IHA population, comparing surgical or pharmacological treatment, to emphasize correlations between PAC and PWV; moreover, the statistical analysis didn ’t show relevant results regarding the dis- tribution of sex, probably due to the low number of cases and different distribution in the groups.In our experience, at constant systolic and diastolic BP values, patients with aldosterone excess had worse PWV and arterial stiffness index, compared to EH patients, and higher μ-albuminuria, as early sign of renal vascular damage, strictly related to subclinical arte- rial damage.[2]D.

ally, to determine CVD risk reduction with fibrate treatment in those individuals with the high triglyceride/low HDL or mixed phenotypes, it is necessary to reference the HHS which studied middle-age Scandina - vian males.The addition of a PCSK-9 inhibitor provides an additional CVD risk reduction of ~5% by reducing his total cholesterol to 130 mg/dl (LDL cholesterol is not used in the calculator, but we can assume that LDL will be proportionately decreased as total cholesterol).George ’s LDL cholesterol would therefore be reduced by ~47% with statin PCSK-9 inhibitor or 84 mg/dl, not quite at goal D70 mg/dl.The addition of a PCSK-9 inhibitor gives Jorge a total CVD risk reduction of 30.9% with ~42% reduction in total cholesterol (Jorges ’ LDL would be ~80 mg/dl).The importance of this information is that EPA tends to be a minor oil component of fish oil, yet it has robust anti-inflammatory properties when compared to LA and DHA.Heterogeneity in those eligible for statin therapy The existence of multiple lipid phenotypes and their respective mechanisms for lipid lowering therapy is supported by the MESA (Multi- ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study.Multiple lipid phenotypes We propose two lipid phenotypes in those with diabetes and the potential for further CVD risk reduction with triglyceride lowering therapy.The utility of coronary CT scan and beyond in profiling type 2 diabetes CVD risk In populations that cannot tolerate statins, coronary calcium scores (CCS) may be a useful tool for the evaluating the indication of lipid lowering therapies.4.Conclusion We propose at least two lipid phenotypes that highlight different mechanisms of CVD risk reduction outside of lowering LDL with statin therapy.International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 14 (2022) 200141 6Credit roles Dr. Bleich formulated the idea, wrote the initial draft of the article, edited the article and final draft, and provided critical review.Dr. Lim revised the article, edited the article, and provided additional text and references to the original draft.A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European association for the study of diabetes (EASD), Diabetes Care 41 (12) (2018) 2669 –2701 .[5]A.

61,Risk-factor-clustering-in-men-and-women_2023_International-Journal-of-Cardio.pdf,"Obesity, central obesity, diabetes and low physical activity were more common in women, while excessive alcohol consumption and unhealthy diet were more common in men.Sex differences persisted in participants with low educational attainment, and women with low educational level had the highest RF burden.Sex differences exist also in cardiovascular risk factors (RF): some RF such as smoking and hypertension are reported to be more common in men, while obesity and diabetes are more prevalent in women [2–4].Studies from different world regions, studying the presence from 4 to 12 cardiovascular RF, show that the prevalence of multiple cardiovascular RF is high and ranges from 45.2% to 99.9% in men and 24.6% –99.8% in women [4–8], although these estimates depend on how many and which RF are included in the analysis.The evidence on sex differences in RF clustering shows diverging results, with studies finding a higher burden of multiple RF in women [7,9] and others in men [4,5,8].The current study aims to investigate differences in the distribution of multiple RF between men and women with established CHD in the southern Cone of Latin America, within CESCAS Study.During the home visit, a standard questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics (including age, sex and educational level), history of cardiovascular disease and RF (including CHD, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and treatment for these conditions), lifestyle RF (such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consump - tion, physical activity and diet).Participants were on a sitting position after 5 min of rest for the blood pressure measurements, and the mean of the 3 readings was used for analysis.We assessed RF clustering as counts and combinations of RF.The prevalence of established CHD was 8.4% in the overall study population, 10.0% in men and 7.3% in women (634 participants with CHD).Cardiometabolic RF as obesity, central obesity and low physical activity were more common in women, while the behavioral RF as smoking, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diets were more prevalent in men (Table 1).Women presented with a higher number of RF than men (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 –1.08, Fig.The most common RF combinations among subjects with ≽4 RF were hypertension/dyslipidemia/obesity/unhealthy diet (28.3% of men and 29.6% of women); and hypertension/diabetes/obesity/unhealthy diet (12.5% of men and 14.1% of women) (Table 3).Results from the subjects with tertiary education showed a lower number of lifestyle RF in women (RR 0.80 0.68 –0.93) although this difference was not reflected in significant differences in the total RF number (Fig.The most common RF combination in men and women with at least 4 RF in all educational groups was hypertension/dyslipidemia/obesity/ unhealthy diet; followed by hypertension/diabetes/obesity/unhealthy diet in participants with primary and secondary schooling, and by hy- pertension/dyslipidemia/insufficient physical activity in participants with university education (Table 3).International Journal of Cardiology Cardiovascular Risk and Prevention 16 (2023) 200172 4occurrence of CHD in men, in combination with the higher participation of women in the study: 57.9% of participants from the overall CESCAS study population were female, and the prevalence of CHD was 6.8% in women and 7.4% in men.We observed that some cardiovascular RF have a very high preva - lence: more than three out of participants were hypertensive, four out of five had an unhealthy diet, more than half of the women were obese, and almost 80% of women had central obesity.The prevalence of most RF was comparable to those observed for Latin American men and women with CHD included in various studies.2.Number of overall, cardiometabolic and total RF in men and women by previous CHD history and educational level.Footnote: Cardiometabolic RF include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and obesity.The higher burden of RF in women may be explained in part because RF that are usually more common in men, such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol, were relatively uncommon in our study population.Wang et al. [10] compared RF clustering in Chinese and Dutch men and women, finding that the most frequent clusters included drinking in men and obesity in women among Chinese, and obesity and hypertension in Dutch women.In our study we found significant sex differences in some combinations including physical inactivity (more common in women), and alcohol use and smoking (more common in men).Estimates represent the expected increase in count of RF in women compared to men controlled by age, in subjects with CHD in general and by educational level.Table 3 Most common combinations of 3 and 4 RF in men and women by previous history of CHD and educational level.There were sex differences in the number of cardiometabolic RF, with women presenting a higher number, but not on the lifestyle RF.Literature shows that lower educational level is associated with presenting with a higher number of RF [5,8,33,34].Previous studies have described that the as- sociation of educational level or other socioeconomic factors with a higher number of RF is stronger in women than in men [11,28,36,38, 51].5.Conclusion Women had a higher burden of multiple cardiovascular RF.Author credits AMF, LG, PG, IV, KKG and VI contributed to the conceptualization of this manuscript.He, Z.

[29] Comprehensively evaluated risk factor control according to the sec- ondary prevention guidelines, and found inadequacy in risk factor control and adherence to recommended lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies.In the present study, we evaluated the adequacy of risk factor control by estimating the proportions of subjects who achieve the target goals for physiological indices, and the degree of compliance with recommended lifestyle and medications in non-institutionalized U.S. adults with HF from the NHANES 1999 –2018.Of the 101,316 NHANES participants ≽18 years old who were interviewed and examined during the ten cal- endar periods, we excluded 45,592 participants who missed the answer to the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor or health profes - sional you have HF?’’.Data collection For this present study, data from the last 10 consecutive cycles of NHANES from 1999 to 2018 were surveyed.For assessing proportions of patients achieving specific physiological targets including BP, serum LDL-C and HbA1c levels, BMI as well as waist circumference, participants were grouped by sex, age (D65 and ≽ 65), race/ethnicity, socioeconomic, education and health insurance statuses as indicated above.Having risk factors uncontrolled or not receiving recommended medications was modeled as the dichotomous dependent variable and the factors of sex, age (groups defined by 18–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and ≽70 years), race/ethnicity, socioeconomic, education, and health insurance statuses, or co-morbidities were modeled as the independent variables.22.04% of respondents were at the goal for LDL-C control, and older patients had significantly higher proportion achieving this target.Characteristics Overall (n 1906) Controlled (n 484) Uncontrolled (n 1422) P Value Age(yrs), mean ±Uncontrolled: ≽2 risk factors (including hypertension [blood pressure ≽130/80 mm Hg], LDL-C ≽70 mg/dL, obesity [body mass index ≽30 kg/m2], current smoking, HbA1c F7% for those HF with DM, and inadequate physical activity [D5 days/week or D30 min/session]) not controlled.After univariate logistic regression, age, gender, socioeconomic status, current health insurance status, MS, and DM were selected to the multivariate logistic regression for having risk factors uncontrolled.On the other hand, age, current health insurance status, MS, CHD, DM, and CKD were selected to the multivariate logistic regression for not receiving recommended medications.Further, the overall taking beta blockers, ACEIs/ARBs, and diuretics, the first-line agents to control hypertension in HF [4,35], is about 54%, 52% and 49%, respectively (Table 4).In addition, although this present study suggests significantly higher ratio of compliance in older participants with beta blockers and diuretics, a previous study describes P value indicates comparison of means or proportions between controlled and uncontrolled groups.Table 2 Achievement of recommended physiological targets in HF patients.In agree with the previous study [42], older patients are more likely to use antihypertensive medications but less likely to meet BP goals than younger patients (Tables 2 and 4 &7).When analyzing physical activity in this present study, we find only about 11% of participants are compliant with recommendation, with female gender, being older than 65, and receiving education less than high school being less likely compliant with physical activities (Table 3).In the absence of details about HF phenotype or stage from NHANES, it is one of our limitations to use only a simple threshold to define inadequate physical activity.In addition, we find DM as a significant predictor of having ≽2 risk factors uncontrolled (Table 6) and a significant determinant of not receiving recommended medica - tions (Table 7), which is in similar with a previous study reporting poor medication adherence in type 2 diabetes [49].The major strength of our present study is that the NHANES data provide a nationally representative sample of the non-institutionalized U.S. population.Lijiang Tang: Conceptualization, Writing – review & editing, Funding acquisition, Supervision.81500284 &81770475 &81701386); the Public Projects of Technol - ogy in Zhejiang Province (Grant No.LGJ18H020001); the Scientific and Table 5 Proportion of HF patients with co-morbidities receiving recommended medical therapy.Yes 1 reference – No 0.18 0.09 –0.36 D0.0001Yes 1 Reference – No 2.84 1.53 –5.25 0.0009[9]K.

Cohort equations (PCE) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Sex Uganda ABSTRACT Introduction: The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is rising in Sub-Saharan Africa, but it is not known whether current risk assessment tools predict coronary atherosclerosis in the region.The median 10-year ASCVD risk score was significantly higher in men (11.0%, IQR 7.6–19.4%) than in women (5.1%, IQR 3.2–8.7%), although the prevalence of CACF0 was similar (8.1 vs 10.5%, p 0.63).When HIV status was added to the ASCVD risk score, correlation with CAC was improved in women but not in men.However, widely-used risk estimators such as the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) [8] have not been adequately validated in sub-Saharan Africa and may not accurately predict risk in this heterogeneous population [9–11].In the global north, there is a well-established association between HIV infection, chronic immune activation and an increased risk of coronary heart disease [19–24].In sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV is more endemic, this translates to 10–15% of the population attributable risk for ASCVD [21].We undertook the current study to investigate the correlation of the PCE 10-year risk score with CAC among adults living in Kampala, Uganda, with particular attention to sex and HIV serostatus.The American College of Cardiology (ACC) Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Estimator was used to assess the 10-year risk of an ASCVD event among all study participants.Women were more likely to have a CRP F3 μg/ml (46% of women vs 30% of men, p  0.02), and more likely to fall into the highest tertile for sCD14 level (35% vs 30%p 0.04), and sCD163 level (38% vs 25%, p 0.02).The AUROC for ASCVD risk score as a predictor of CACF0 was 0.57 among women and 0.70 among men (Table 3).When the model was adjusted to include HIV, the AUROC improved from 0.57 to 0.78 for women (p 0.02 for difference between the models, Fig.Our results suggest that prevalence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, as defined by CAC, is reasonably well balanced by sex in this population, but that risk estimation via the PCE does not adequately discriminate risk among women.In that study, Shaw et al. found that 40% of women and 63% of men had CAC F0.Table 2 Comparison of ASCVD 10-year risk categories by sex (N, %) Race other.The percentage of the sample with and without detectable coronary artery calcium is displayed by 10-year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Prevalence of detectable coronary artery calcium is not significantly associated with 10- year ASCVD risk in women (1A) but increases with increasing ASCVD risk in men (1B).2.ROC Curves for the Predictive Value of ASCVD Risk for CACF0.Receiver operating characteristic curves are demonstrated for the association between 10- year ASCVD risk as predicted by the pooled cohort equations and the prevalence of coronary artery calcium in women (2A) and men (2B) with and without adjustment for HIV.In women, the AUROC for 10-year ASCVD risk score as a predictor of CAC was only 0.58, indicating a poor correlation, but improved to 0.78 after adjustment for HIV.While some work has shown that CAC may be more useful for reclassifying ASCVD risk in men [39], Shaw et al. demonstrated that any detectable CAC was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality among women compared to men, and that this differential risk was magnified in subgroups with multivessel CAC or large lesions [29].Limitations By nature of the cross-sectional study design and small sample size, we are not able to draw conclusions about the directionality of effects of HIV or CVD risk factors on CAC or assess for interaction with specific HIV parameters such as type of antiretroviral therapy.Additional research is needed to further explore the contributions of sex and HIV status to risk estimation for this population, establish accurate risk prediction tools, and to build mitigation strategies that respond to unique risk profiles.Onen, Epidemiology of ischaemic heart disease in sub-Saharan Africa : review article, Cardiovasc, J.

pertensive medication adherence, but remain largely untested especially in vulnerable populations which stand to benefit the most.The Behavioral Economics Trial To Enhance Regulation of Blood Pressure (BETTER-BP) was designed in this context, to test whether a digitally-enabled incentive lottery improves antihypertensive adherence and reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP).The incentive lottery is delivered via short messaging service (SMS) text messages that are delivered based on (1) antihypertensive adherence tracked via a wireless electronic monitoring device, paired with (2) a probability of lottery winning with variable incentives and a regret component for nonadherence.This pragmatic randomized trial, which is conducted at three safety-net clinics in New York City, builds on foundational work in behavioral economics [17,18] to test whether a lottery incentive program promotes adherence to antihypertensive medication and blood pressure control at 6 and 12 months.Conceptual model BETTER-BP is designed based on self-determination theory (SDT) (Fig.Although it may seem counter - intuitive to pair a short-term lottery incentive, based on principles of behavioral economics (an extrinsic motivator) with the concept of building autonomous motivation and competence for behavior change, several studies in health-related behaviors have found that behavioral economic interventions do not “crowd out” intrinsic motivation [21,22].Importantly, the resultant increase in autonomous motivation reinforces an individual ’s feelings of compe - tence, which can in turn sustain the behavior change, even when the incentive is extinguished [25].Eligibility criteria Patients are eligible for BETTER-BP if the following criteria are met: age ≽18 years, clinical diagnosis of hypertension, on ≽1 antihyperten - sive medication, suboptimal blood pressure control (defined as ≽1 outpatient systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≽140 within the past year), and poor self-reported adherence (defined as D80% adherent with pre- scribed antihypertensive medication over the prior week).4.Study intervention The intervention consists of a lottery incentive program (“regret lottery ”) that is delivered for 6 months via lottery software that is paired with an adherence EMD.Although all participants in the intervention arm are entered in the lottery each day, they are eligible to win only if the bottle is opened the day before.When possible, medications are placed in the EMD on the day of the initial study visit.Control group Participants in the control group receive an AdhereTech EMD in order to passively monitor adherence with a single antihypertensive agent over the course of the study (12 months).Similar to the intervention arm, the primary endpoint (SBP) is measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.Study visits All participants undergo visits at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.All 3 visits are led by a research coordinator who measures elements in Table 2.2.Potential conditions in incentive lottery.≡Safety events* Chart abstraction** ≡BP values recorded at ambulatory visits (baseline to 6 months) ≡Laboratory values (baseline to 6 months) ≡Hospitalizations (baseline to 6 months) In-person assessment ≡Blood pressure, pulse≡Return AdhereTech EMD ≡Safety events* Chart abstraction** ≡BP values recorded at ambulatory visits (6–12 months) ≡Laboratory values (6–12 months) ≡Hospitalizations (6–12 months) Intervention arm only In-person assessment ≡Introduction to lottery incentive app (via Way to Health) ≡Daily lottery incentive via Way to Health (baseline to 6 months) Return study-provided smartphone, if applicable *Safety events include adverse events plausibly related to better antihypertensive adherence (fall-related injury, syncope, hypotension, bradycardia, renal or elec- trolyte abnormality), and will be assessed by interview to capture both in-system and out-of-system utilization.All potential safety endpoints are reported directly to the Principal Investigator and subsequently the DSMB.We will fit lon- gitudinal mixed effects models (MEM) of the 3 repeated SBP measures (baseline, 6 months, 12 months), with indicator for treatment arm as a binary covariate, site-level fixed effects, patient-specific random effects, and modeling time using indicator variables or using piecewise linear splines, to allow differential rates of change from baseline to 6 months and from 6 months to 12 months.To evaluate the durable effect of the incentive lottery on adherence (after cessation of the study intervention), we will perform similar analyses between 6 and 12 months.We will test whether the following characteristics are significant: motivation, self-efficacy, age (≽65 years), sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, patient-reported health status, depressive symptoms, and medication burden, based on prior literature [41,42].For the outcome of adherence (dichotomized at ≽80% adherent vs. D80% adherent), we will have 93% power to detect a 20% difference in adherence between groups, and 80% power to detect a 15% difference, assuming a baseline adherence rate in the control group of about 25%.For example, Bailey et al. reported that over 60% of Medicaid-insured patients with hypertension in Tennessee were non- adherent with antihypertensive medications (using a threshold of days adherent D80%) [1].The BETTER-BP study intervention takes place for 6 months, and our design aims to evaluate whether there are both immediate (6 months) and durable (12 months) effects of the incentive lottery.In this context, BETTER-BP will generate evidence that is complementary to the foundational work of Shapiro and colleagues.Second, we are using an EMD as a proxy for antihypertensive adherence (rather than measuring it directly).In conclusion, BETTER-BP will test whether behavioral economics incentives for antihypertensive medication adherence are effective in vulnerable populations.You took your medication and won the lottery.Keep going, you could win tomorrow!156 You took your medication yesterday, but your numbers weren ’t drawn.160 You took your medication yesterday, but your numbers weren ’t drawn.Will, F.

The increasing popularity of social networks and mobile health apps has led to the emergence of ‘mobile health ’, a term that combines the use of mobile devices and wireless technologies to support health initiatives both as a method of patient follow-up and data collection and as an effective means of health education and promotion [6].Given the importance of hypertension as one of the leading risk factors for CVDs and the high prevalence of this condition, it is possible to study the effectiveness of methods of informing people with hypertension about the primary prevention of CVDs using the Instagram social media platform.2.Purpose To identify the most effective way to provide information for the education of patients with hypertension in primary prevention using a social network.At Stage 2 from 945 respondents wishing to participate in the study 125 participants were randomly selected and assigned into one of the four training groups using a random number generator: 1.One week before the training start, a png file with an adapted HDKQ with additional questions on gender, age, education, duration of hy- pertension, smoking status and body mass index (BMI) was sent to all participants in direct messages.The number of correct re- sponses before training, after training, and the difference between the number of correct responses before and after training for each study subject were used as the dependent variable.After school, the number of correct answers increased to 49%.After school, the number of correct answers increased to 47%.The regression analysis showed that the post-training number of correct responses in Group 4 increased on average by 3.9 compared to Group 3 (β 3.94 p 0.04 (CI, 0.21; 7.66) (Table 4).No association was found between gender, age, education and the number of correct responses both before and after training (Table 4).Factor β p 95% CI for β β p 95% CI for β Time before training after training Gender (Female ref)  0.50 0.760  3.73; 2.74  0.33 0.823  3.28; 2.62 Age  0.05 0.270  0.13; 0.04  0.07 0.051  0.14; 0.00 Education (Secondary ref)  0.05 0.970  2.72; 2.62 1.70 0.176  0.78; 4.18 Group (3 ref) 1 1.76 0.198  0.94; 4.46 3.67 0.005 1.18; 6.15 2 0.37 0.786  2.33; 3.07 2.33 0.062  0.12; 4.78 4 0.83 0.551  1.92; 3.58 3.34 0.011 0.79; 5.90 Duration of hypertension 0.20 0.007 0.06; 0.34 0.16 0.005 0.05; 0.27 History of smoking 0.43 0.011 0.10; 0.76 0.08 0.624  0.23; 0.39 Height 1.44 0.972  80.9; 83.79  9.23 0.798  80.92; 62.46 Weight  0.04 0.932  0.93; 0.85 0.12 0.768  0.67; 0.90At the same time, the effectiveness of education through social media was studied in a limited number of patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus [24].7.Conclusions Thus, as shown in this study, in all the 4 groups there was a tendency to increase in the number of correct responses after training, but among the training modes, the most effective method of informing people about the primary prevention of hypertension using a social media website corresponded to the following sequence: a video clip of up to 5 min followed by a text post of up to 4000 characters.Bezzubtseva Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – original draft preparation, Writing- Reviewing and Editing; A.E.Aksenova, et al., Testing the educational program “primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases ” on the basis of social networking service Instagram, Russ.Health 18 (1) (2018), https:// doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5837-3 .Feitosa, A.D.M.Feitosa, A.M.G.Graff, et al., Benefit of social media on patient engagement and satisfaction: results of a 9-month, qualitative pilot study using Facebook, Surg (United States) 163 (3) (2018) 565–570, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.Turin, Social media in communicating health information: an analysis of Facebook groups related to hypertension, Prev.[26] A.A.

the mean of the numerical risk perception increased for every step on the categorical risk perception scale (Fig.Categorical risk perception Univariate analyses revealed that a low level of physical activity, high level of stress, higher BMI, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, CVD, family history of MI, worse general health, shortness of breath, and chest pain were associated with high perceived risk.Numerical risk perception Univariate analysis showed that higher age, lower health literacy level, higher BMI, smoking, lower level of exercise, diabetes, hyper - tension, high cholesterol, shortness of breath, chest pain, family history of MI, and worse general health were associated with a higher perceived risk, expressed as a risk percentage.High choles - terol predicted if respondents perceived their MI risk as higher to that of others, and a higher percentage of perceived ten-year risk.It may therefore be appropriate to choose general health as a predictor of CVD risk perception, and furthermore, to adjust for general health when studying the association of other risk factors and risk perception.Although, it is possible that different CV conditions have different impact on risk perception, and that association of the experience of MI with risk perception was diluted when combining it with other CV conditions.The two risk perception measurements used in this study were strongly correlated with each other; respondents that perceived their risk as higher than others also perceived their risk to be higher in nu- merical terms.The overall model fit for the linear regression was low; the predictors only explained 13.5% of the variation in the numerical measurement, and the range of answers was quite wide.This assumption was strengthened by the fact that more participants skipped the numerical question about risk, which might be an indication that they found it more difficult to answer this compared to the categorical question.Therefore, if the average person perceives his or her risk to be 12%, but is presented with a risk that is 5%, he or she may think of it as very low, while a 5% Table 2 Odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals of predictors for perceiving MI risk lower or higher than others.No common reference point was included with the numerical measurement in this study, which is a limitation since it could have helped the respondents.Another interesting finding from the univariate analyses was that respondents with low education, self-reported knowledge of CVD risk factors, heath literacy, and numeracy were more likely to respond that they perceived their CVD risk as “same as others ”, rather than “lower ” or “higher ” risk than others.In prediction models, confounding is not an issue, however, it is crucial that the sample is representative for the population for which the model will used [27].However, in the case of risk perception, it seems appropriate to focus on risk factors that the individuals believe they have.Lifestyle factors (BMI, physical activity), and stress dominated the predictors for perceiving MI risk as lower than others, while high cholesterol predicted higher MI risk perception.Memish, Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, Lancet 380 (2012) 2095 –2128 .Griffin, Impact of provision of cardiovascular disease risk estimates to healthcare professionals and patients: a systematic review, BMJ Open 5 (2015), e008717 .de Lemos, T.M.Berry, Perceived lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease (from the Dallas Heart Study), Am.[16] Å.
